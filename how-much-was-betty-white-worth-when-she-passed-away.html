Thanks to her decades of hard and excellent work, Betty had managed to build up a lifetime's worth of riches to her name.</p><p>As of the fateful day when the world eventually lost her talent, Betty was estimated to be worth around $75 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=betty-white-originally-wanted-to-be-a-forest-ranger>Betty White Originally Wanted To Be A Forest Ranger</h2><p>Betty White was born in Oak Park, Illinois in January 1922. She attended Horace Mann Elementary School and later joined Beverly Hills High school. Her family used to vacation in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California, which triggered a keen interest in wildlife for her as a young girl.</p><p>This passion <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">almost led Betty down a completely different career path</a>, as she really wanted to become a forest ranger. Unfortunately for her at the time, women were not allowed to practice the profession, and so that particular dream was crushed rather early on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully for the rest of the world, her momentary loss would turn out to be her fans' great gain. While at Horace Mann, Betty wrote and played the lead role in a graduation play.
