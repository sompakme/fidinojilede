Rather than lay low, however, Britney has done her best to show her followers she’s doing okay, <a href=#>including throwing a “divorce party.”</a></p><p>Last week, the singer made headlines for featuring a series of shirtless men on her Instagram, while they partied together at her California mansion. In a video clip, Britney could be seen rolling around on a bed without wearing a shirt. During one moment, she extended her leg into the air to reveal nothing but her underwear and thigh-high boots.</p><p>In a separate video, the former Disney sensation had her leg humorously licked by an unidentified man. A voice from off-camera could be heard instructing, "Begin at the boot, bro." Further clips presented Britney in a translucent green mini dress, being lifted by a group of shirtless men near her outdoor pool.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Will Sam Asghari Get Paid For Britney Spears' New Book?</a></span></p><p>While Sam hasn't provided a direct comment on Britney's so-called "divorce party," reports say the Lioness star remains resolute in his choice to pursue divorce, bolstered by Britney's recent online actions.</p><p>“Sam isn’t sure if Britney was trying to get his attention on social media by throwing a divorce party and partying with other men, but it’s none of his business,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told Us Weekly</a>. “It only reinforces his feelings on the split and knowing he did the right thing.”</p><h2 id=britney-is-paying-for-sam-rsquo-s-10-000-apartment>Britney Is Paying For Sam’s $10,000 Apartment</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sam-asghari-s-reaction-revealed-after-britney-spears-dances-with-shirtless-men-during-divorce-party.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sam reportedly moved out of the home he once shared with Britney (his name reportedly isn’t on the deed). He’s reportedly living in a nearby luxury apartment, and it appears Britney is footing the bill, at the recommendation of her lawyers.</p><p>The standard price for the unit is reportedly $10,000. Nevertheless, Sam apparently negotiated a more advantageous agreement, securing an apartment at a lower cost.</p><p>Given the strained nature of Sam and Britney's break-up, it may come across as unexpected that she’s covering the cost for his post-split rental. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speaking to TMZ</a>, insiders suggest that Britney's team views this as a strategic decision. This move is prompted by the fact that Sam's legal counsel has hinted at a possible contestation of the prenuptial agreement, a situation that could result in a costly divorce settlement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have been rumors that Sam wants to challenge his and Britney’s prenup, since it only entitled him to a million-dollar payout after 2 years of marriage, though he filed for divorce after only 14 months. However, Sam has denied the allegations via a statement from his representative, and the divorce remains ongoing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmqVdlsCotMCroGatnpu8rbjOsKpmmqKewa%2Bx2GaqqZ2Rp8Butc2sq5qfopa6br%2FHnqeasaNirrGt0a2knqakYrGqws6rmp5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
