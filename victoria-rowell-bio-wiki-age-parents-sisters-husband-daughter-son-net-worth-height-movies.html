Rowell knew very little about her father.</p><p>Dorothy, who suffered from schizophrenia, took a taxi to a hospital to give birth to Rowell, leaving a son as well as two small daughters unsupervised. When she was 16 days old, Rowell, alongside her two sisters, Sheree and Lori, was surrendered to child services.</p><p>While living in Maine with foster parents Agatha C. and Robert Armstead,Rowell, then eight, started ballet lessons. She became a member of Sigma Gamma Rho sorority, an African-American Greek-lettered sorority. After dancing with the American Ballet Theater II as well as the Juilliard School of Music Dance Extension program with Antony Tudor, Rowell accepted guest-artist teaching posts in New England.</p><p>In an interview, Victoria revealed that she was abused while at her foster home but her foster mother Agatha always encouraged her together with her sister to write to their biological mother and also encouraged their ambitions. “There was a violent individual, who will remain nameless, who would beat my sister Sheree and me mercilessly… Agatha was the gateway to what was my passion, and that was fine arts,”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=victoria-rowell-mother-dorothy-rowell></span>Victoria Rowell Mother <strong>Dorothy Rowell</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><strong>Rowell’s biological mother, Dorothy Mabel Collins Rowell, suffered from schizophrenia and died in September 1983 of lung cancer. </strong>In her memoir ‘The Women Who Raised Me’ she revealed that at the age of seven her biological mother came to visit her at her foster home but she was never introduced as her mother.</p><p>‘I had felt something for Dorothy from the moment we first met, even though her visit was unannounced to Forest Edge, the farm in West Lebanon, Maine, an almsfarm township in the 1800s, where I spent my early childhood.</p><p>No one, not even Agatha, the woman I called “Ma,” explained who this outsider was. We were black. She was not. For me, at seven years old, the world broke down simply that way. Still, she was more than a stranger. In her pink gingham food-stained dress, hair swept up into a messy French twist. Compromised beauty. All tortured.</p><p>My childhood memories were just as cryptic. Though her visit to Forest Edge when I was seven years old had been unexplained at first, I later found out that her three-day stay had been carefully planned in trademark Agatha Armstead fashion—meaning that it was done for a reason, to gently introduce Dorothy to me, paving the way for an understanding of what that word foster meant.’</p><p>Dorothy was housed at Maine Insane Hospital in Maine where she spent portions of her adult life. In 1999 Vitoria made a trip to the asylum so that she could relive her mother’s memory.</p><p>‘In 1999 I made a trip alone to Maine to visit the aging Hallowell granite-and-brick asylum where my mother had spent portions of her adult life… Although it was a gray day, light streamed in through a gable.</p><p>I felt the atomic fragments of Dorothy’s faded presence and, I daresay, her anguish. In the background were patients, languishing in a medicinal haze, perhaps holding on to the hope that someday a loved one might come to rescue them. But this day, I had come to rescue and resurrect my mother.’</p><p>Dorothy had six children; three boys and three girls who were each of different paternity. Dorothy’s family deemed her unfit to raise her four younger children and were put in the foster care system.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=victoria-rowell-sisters></span>Victoria Rowell Sisters<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><strong>Victoria has two sisters Sheree Rowell and Lori Rowell.</strong> They were all brought up in foster homes as their mother could not take care of them since she had schizophrenia. The three of them were put under the care of Agatha Armstead and her husband Robert. Victoria revealed that together with her sister Sheree they were abused by one of Agatha’s relatives.</p><p>“Agatha was elderly so she called upon [a relative], this monster of an individual, for help, thinking she was doing the right thing. Because I was Sheree’s defender, I was punished too. I don’t know why, but everybody looked the other way.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=victoria-rowell-husband-wedding-is-she-married></span><span>Victoria Rowell Husband, Wedding: Is she married?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Rowell was first married to Tom Fahey.</strong> the couple married in 1989 and divorced in 1990.
