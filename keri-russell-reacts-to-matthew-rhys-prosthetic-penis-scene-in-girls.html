Who do you have sex with on the show? Or which version of all the girls are you sleeping with?’ And he was like, ‘Well, it’s not quite like that.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>She then detailed the drama over the show allowing him to pick which prosthetic he wanted to wear. “Then there was the whole thing where he got to choose his own [prosthetic penis],” she said. “But he’s in such an awkward position. He was like, ‘If I chose a giant one, people are going to be like, ‘What a dick.’ So he’s like, ‘I just, like, let someone else do it.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Rhys, <a href=#>who welcomed a son, Sam, with his <i>Americans </i>costar last year</a>, previously explained that he was asked to select the prosthetic, but he didn’t offer his input. “They kindly offered, and I said, ‘No, thank you. You choose,’” he told Vulture last month.&nbsp;</p><p>When he saw the final option, Rhys just went with it. “I said, ‘That’s fine, thank you. That’s the one I’ll use,’” he said. “It wasn’t the one used by<b> Mark Wahlberg</b> in <i>Boogie Nights.</i> No. Clearly not. That one is far larger!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknaKeerPB0qycpaRdp7Kir9OsZK2nXaKutcDHnq5mqpiuwG680aiqraCVqbakec%2BepaKrXaiwprrEZqCnZZeev62%2FjLBrcGplaYVw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
