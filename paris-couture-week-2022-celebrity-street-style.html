The duo made their red carpet couple debut at the Kenzo fashion show on Sunday, January 23, in <a href=#>matching Canadian tuxedos</a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The 31-year-old Uncut Gems actress was decked out in Schiaparelli, while the 44-year-old rapper stayed true to his go-to, Balenciaga. But it was Fox’s wild black eye makeup (which was done by West no less) that got all of the attention.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>By the time Monday, January 24, rolled around, <strong>Stella Banderas</strong>’ gorgeous look was all the internet could buzz about. The actress, who is <a href=#><strong>Antonio Banderas</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Melanie Griffith</strong></a>’s daughter, arrived at the Christian Dior show in a red skirt suit, which she accessorized with a white Lady Dior bad and black slingback pumps.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Stella wasn’t the only big name to stop and pose for a picture pre-show. <a href=#><strong>Cara Delevingne</strong> </a>was also in attendance — and she brought with her a geometric hairstyle that’s bound to end up on inspo boards everywhere.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The fashion didn’t stop there though. The Chanel show, which went down on Tuesday, January 25, brought out a slew of stars. <a href=#><strong>Margot Robbie</strong></a> was obviously front row. The Wolf of Wall Street star, who has <a href=#>been working with the fashion house f</a>or years, looked simply stunning strutting down the street. She proved that winter whites are here to stay, rocking a crisp pair of booties, chic-as-can-be coat and micro bag.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Bling Empire star <a href=#><strong>Christine Chiu</strong></a>&nbsp;was also spotted outside. She looked sleek in an understated black dress, which was paired with tons of jewels (obviously) and a quilted bag.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>To see all of these looks and more of the amazing street style from Paris Couture Week, keep scrolling. Because from <a href=#><strong>Naomi Campbell</strong></a>’s all-black look at the Dior Men’s fashion show to <a href=#><strong>Pharrell Williams</strong></a>’ cool camo-print puffer that he wore while en route to Chanel, we’re rounding up the best street style looks, ahead!<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvPmqmiq12YvLbA1KucZq%2BVmrhufo9raWablaGyo77IrbBmq6SnsqbAjKyrsqSVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
