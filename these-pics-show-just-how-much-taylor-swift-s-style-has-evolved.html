As seen from the photos above, back then Taylor rocked her signature tiny curls and some classic 2000 fashion which included plenty of brightly colored off-the-shoulder tops!</p><h2 id=by-2006-taylor-s-most-well-known-accessory-was-her-guitar><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>By 2006 Taylor's Most Well-Known Accessory Was Her Guitar</span></h2><p>In 2006 Taylor Swift released her debut single "Tim McGraw" from her self-titled debut album and with that she quickly rose to stardom. At the time, Taylor's go-to looks always included very defined curls and of course her guitar. The musician's outfits were always very girly and chic and at the time the star was almost never taking any fashion risks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2008-was-all-about-side-swept-curls-and-sparkly-dresses><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>2008 Was All About Side-Swept Curls And Sparkly Dresses</span></h2><p>In the next couple of years, Taylor Swift's style certainly changed a bit — but at the end of the day, Taylor Swift in 2008 was still all about curly hair and girly dresses.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="Harry Styles' 10 Best Stage Outfits" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry Styles' 10 Best Stage Outfits</a></span></p><p>As seen from the photos above, Taylor did like rocking dark eyeliner but it was always in combination with lots of sparkly jewelry or a full-on sparkly dress!</p><h2 id=and-two-years-later-the-sparkly-dresses-were-still-there-but-the-curls-were-gone><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>And Two Years Later The Sparkly Dresses Were Still There — But The Curls Were Gone</span></h2><p>By the end of the 2000s, Taylor Swift's style started changing a bit more and while the musician — who is known for having <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">plenty of famous friends</a> in her inner circle — did still enjoy wearing pretty dresses, she would often ditch the signature curls and opt for an edgier rocker-chic straight hairstyle, as seen in the photos above. Little did fans know at the time that Taylor would soon explore even edgier looks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=in-2012-taylor-was-all-about-hats-and-high-waisted-shorts><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>In 2012 Taylor Was All About Hats And High Waisted Shorts</span></h2><p>In 2012 Taylor Swift released her fourth studio album Red which included plenty of hits such as "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" and "I Knew You Were Trouble", and during that era, the musician definitely had a very distinct style.

Yes, as seen in the photos above — Taylor also cut her hair to a shoulder-length bob which certainly suited the musician extremely well!</p><h2 id=and-two-years-later-the-pop-star-even-gave-us-some-edginess><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>And&nbsp;Two&nbsp;Years Later The Pop Star Even Gave Us Some Edginess</span></h2><p>As most of Taylor Swift's fans will agree, 2016 was a year in which Taylor gave us some of her most edgy looks as the star was rocking a super <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">short bob haircut</a> at the time — and she certainly experimented with different kinds of outfits and makeup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="Kendall Jenner's 10 Best Steet Fashion Looks" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendall Jenner's 10 Best Steet Fashion Looks</a></span></p><p>As seen from the photos above, Taylor even opted to go platinum blonde and rock black lipstick — something that no one could imagine the young musician doing in 2004!</p><h2 id=which-she-explored-even-more-in-2017><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Which She Explored Even More In 2017</span></h2><p>In 2017 Taylor released her sixth studio album Reputation and by then it was evident that Taylor does not care what others think of her anymore. The musician became fiercely independent and would speak her mind whenever she could — and when it comes to fashion Taylor wore whatever she liked regardless of what others may think! Taylor's Reputation era certainly gave us some of her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most iconic stage outfits</a>!</p><h2 id=in-2019-taylor-decided-to-rock-bold-colors><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>In 2019 Taylor Decided To Rock Bold Colors</span></h2><p>Taylor's seventh studio album Lover was released in 2019 and with its release, Taylor certainly decided to embrace colors more often. As seen from the photos above, rocking boring monochromatic looks was definitely not something Taylor enjoyed as the star certainly developed a love for funky cuts and colorful materials! While Taylor's style did change, her lyrics <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">remained just as relatable</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-today-the-musician-is-all-about-simplicity><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>And Today The Musician Is All About Simplicity</span></h2><p>And finally — wrapping the list up is the musician's current style.
