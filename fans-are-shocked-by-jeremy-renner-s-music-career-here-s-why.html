Jeremy Renner, the man of few words and Hawkeye from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MCU</a> himself, has a music career. So it appears as if he isn't the only superhero to have dabbled in music. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">His buddy, Scarlett Johansson</a>, had a brief music career and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released a couple of albums</a>, as did Brie Larson, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was actually sort of pushed into it</a> when she was younger.Maybe they should start a band and play as their Marvel characters. That's something we'd love to see. But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Renner isn't too much of a Larson fan</a>, allegedly, so that wouldn't work, unfortunately.We're not even completely convinced of Renner's talents yet, either. It's tough for some actors-turned-musicians. Just because you can act doesn't mean you can or should sing. Don't get us wrong, there are definitely a lot of actors, like Hugh Jackman, for instance, who could sell out the biggest stadiums and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have a very successful music career if they chose to</a>. But there are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">more than a few who have tried and majorly failed</a>. They shouldn't have gone there, but they did, sadly.Here's what we know about Renner's music career.[EMBED_INSTA]https://www.instagram.com/p/CF0ACN1jrKl/[/EMBED_INSTA]</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=music-has-always-been-very-important-to-him>Music Has Always Been Very Important To Him</h2><p>Many fans don't know that music has always been a huge part of Renner's life, even more than acting actually. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It was his first love</a>.</p><p>"Acting came into my brain around 20. Music has always been my first love as far as something other than my family," Renner told People.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Jeremy Renner Did Before He Was An Actor</a></span></p><p>He also revealed that one summer, when he was 12 years old, he made his own instruments out of cardboard. "I put on a show, and I charged my sister a dollar and all her friends a dollar to come in and watch us play cardboard instruments. I think I made five bucks!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When he was able to get actual instruments, he taught himself how to play piano, guitar, and drums. He's been recording music here and there ever since. He's also had a studio in his home for a little while, which he loves because he gets to record new things around his family. "[One thing that] makes [music] greater is that I get to stay here in my home and do it and get to be around the people I love."</p><h2 id=he-s-released-music-for-his-various-films>He's Released Music For His Various Films</h2><p>Over the years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Renner has combined his love for music in film</a> by recording songs for his various films. He recorded the song "I Drink Alone" for the soundtrack for the drama North Country, and he also made a couple of tracks for the films Love Comes to the Executioner and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. In the credits of the film Tag, Renner sings a cover of Crash Test Dummies "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremy Renner Will Continue To Play Hawkeye In The MCU Despite Accusations</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2018, Renner sang on Sam Feldt's single "Heaven (Don't Have a Name)." He's released a couple of his own singles too, including a cover of The Animals' "The House of the Rising Sun," and three original songs, "Main Attraction," "Nomad," and "Sign," which he did for an ad campaign for Jeep. He also released his first EP, "The Medicine," in 2020.</p><p>Multiple publications have described his sound as being a combination of Imagine Dragons and Queen. Another thing they can agree on? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">That his music career is bizarre</a>, and it completely blindsided them, even though it was right in front of them the whole time, displayed quite heavily on Renner's own Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Men's Health wrote that "once you hit that little triangle button that sets the video in motion, you became immediately entrenched in the bizarre world of Jeremy Renner, Musician. It's something like The Matrix: once you enter, there's no turning back."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Pursued A Music Career That Failed</a></span></p><p>"Let's take a second here," they continued. "I know you'll need it. I needed it. First off, no, your breakfast didn't have any LSD in it (not that I know of, at least)—that's Jeremy Renner, star of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, busting out some Imagine Dragons-esque bars in what looks like a home recording studio, followed by a few seconds of what sounds like a song that really wants to be played in a commercial for a new brand of lumber. If you told me this little video was a skit in the upcoming second season (!) of Tim Robinson's absurdist Netflix sketch comedy show I Think You Should Leave, I would not bat an eye and would go on with my life. But that does not appear to be the case."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"What is going on here? Seriously, what in the world is happening? Why is this happening? I don't like it. It doesn't make any sense. Make it stop. How did we all miss this?" they continued to be flabbergasted.</p><p>"I think there's only one thing to do after exposure to this: Just accept Jeremy Renner for what he is. Accept that Hawkeye is not just any actor but an eccentric house-flipping, music-making, multi-hyphenate hopeful star and occasional actor in superhero movies that make billions of dollars," they concluded. Fair enough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans couldn't believe it just as much as Men's Health. "Jeremy Renner's music sounds like Taylor Hicks fronting Imagine Dragons," one person wrote. Others were less than psyched about Renner's style, "Jeremy Renner does not have friends who are honest with him."</p><p>Even if people don't like his music or are just generally gobsmacked by it, Renner will still release music no matter what. When asked if he'd put out an album, Renner seemed unsure but positive about it. "That’s a future thing. I’m happy to share music now, which I wasn’t before," he said. Anyway, let's allow Renner to live out his dream. Hawkeye, the musician.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Look Into Joe Pesci's Forgotten Music Career</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYq6zsYysn6ibm5qxbq7YZqGeqpWixm6%2BxKelnqqjYrq2v8icZJyZopqys3nHnqmeq12stbp7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
