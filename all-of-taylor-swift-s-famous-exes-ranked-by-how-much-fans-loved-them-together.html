Not only have the two been dating far longer than fans were ever aware of, Swift was even visiting Kelce at his games <a href=#>before the relationship was hard launched in September 2023</a>. With Kelce traveling to see Swift at her shows overseas and the two getting together when they can for the next several months, this time apart will be a true test for the couple.</p><h2 id=john-mayer><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>John Mayer</span></h2><h3 id=dated-december-2009-to-february-2010>Dated: December 2009 to February 2010</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar48226986.png><ul><li><strong>Taylor Swift and John Mayer have no contact with each other</strong></li></ul><p>These two singers only dated for a few short months, from December 2009 to February 2010.

It was revealed that Swift actually wrote Harris' new hit song, "This Is What You Came For," and he was none too pleased about the reveal.
