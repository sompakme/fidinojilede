The couple bought the home from art collector Bill Bell Jr, who took over a decade to construct the custom build from the ground up.

In total, the property comes with 8-acres of land.</p><p>This isn’t the only luxury mansion the couple own in the area. They also have a Bel-Air estate, which they bought in 2017 for $88 million. The home is now reportedly worth over $100 million after the pair invested in various renovations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple’s <a href=#>Bel-Air mansion also features 30,000 square feet</a> of living space, which includes 11 bathrooms and 8 pools. Sitting on 8 acres, the home has 4 pools, a basketball court, and a tennis court. It’s other amenities include a recording studio. Plus, it came fully furnished.</p><p>Beyonce and Jay-z’s latest investment may be the most expensive real estate purchase in California’s history, but it’s not the priciest in all the country. A Central Park South high-rise sold to hedge fund founder Ken Griffin in 2019 for $236 million, the most expensive real estate transaction in United States history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps what was most surprising about Ken’s purchase was that it was <a href=#>part of a larger $700 million shopping spree</a>. Around the same time, the billionaire dropped $200 million to buy land in Palm Beach, Florida to construct a custom build. He also bought property in London, England for $122 million, which was the city’s most expensive real estate sale in a decade at the time.</p><p>Though there’s nothing to suggest Jay-Z and Beyonce are shopping around for more property, their real estate portfolio is becoming big enough to compete with Ken’s collection.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Thieves Evade Arrest After Burglarizing JoJo Siwa's Home</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>AD</a>, <a href=#>CNBC</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmabnamku6SxjKOYsmWqYrGzu89maWloXaK2rbjIqKVmp55isKK4yJ%2Bmq6aZlsBuuc6sq2adqKWyr7%2FIr5xmoJ%2BisnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
