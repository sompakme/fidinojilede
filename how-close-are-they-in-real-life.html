Fans were never sure if their favorite stars dated or not!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No one knew what kind of relationship Nina Dobrev shared with Paul Wesley&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">(who is directing these days)</a>&nbsp;back then, or what kind of relationship they share now. Whether they were actually dating each other or not was a big question, until both actors decided to clear up the rumors once and for all. Here is our take on their story of love and hate.</p><h2 id=how-did-it-start><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>How Did It Start?</span></h2><p>Thanks to Paul and Nina’s outstanding performances on the screen, they made their fans believe they were in a serious relationship. The duo first met on the set of the popular show, The Vampire Diaries, and played lovers from 2009 to 2017. However, contrary to their onscreen romantic relationship, they couldn’t stand each other near the beginning of the show.</p><h2 id=a-bitter-beginning><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>A Bitter Beginning</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview</a>, Dobrev mentioned that they literally ‘despised’ each other for the first five months. Although she respected Paul, she didn't like him at all.&nbsp;When asked about this,&nbsp; Wesley agreed. He revealed that the audience might find their on-screen pairing to be adorable, but their off-screen relationship wasn’t good at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was some strange kind of relationship which was hard to understand. They used to go in opposite directions as soon as the shoot was over.</p><h2 id=when-they-opened-up-about-their-feud-friendship><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>When They Opened Up About Their Feud-Friendship</span></h2><p>It was during a chat with fellow co-stars, Kayla Ewell and Candice King, on the podcast, Directionally Challenged, that Nina Dobrev, for the first time, commented about the bitter aspects of the off-screen relationship.</p><p>She admitted that she was annoyed by the fact that people on the set used to ask her if she and Paul were dating each other. Plus, a lot of their fans believed that they had that romantic flicker between them. It was then that she realized there is a very thin line between love and hate. Their hatred for each other was being perceived as love.</p><h2 id=the-secret-of-their-on-screen-chemistry><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>The Secret Of Their On-Screen Chemistry</span></h2><p>For the first few years of working together on the series, they continued disliking each other. Thanks to their amazing professionalism and acting skills, they both left their fans thinking the exact opposite. They looked so good together on the screen that everybody thought they were actually dating each other in real life, as previously mentioned.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Times We Really Didn't Like Elena Gilbert On The Vampire Diaries</a></span></p><h2 id=the-reason-they-clashed-on-the-set><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The Reason They Clashed On The Set</span></h2><p>Now, the biggest question is, "If they had such wonderful on-screen chemistry, what made them distance themselves from each other off-screen in the beginning?" According to Wesley, the biggest reason was that they worked with each other non-stop for years. It was just too much. It was extreme, and an extreme of anything is generally not good.</p><h2 id=how-their-views-about-each-other-changed><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>How Their Views About Each Other Changed?</span></h2><p>While working together constantly, people often get tired and upset, and they may begin to hate each other. According to Business Insider,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the level of monotony and hatred</a>&nbsp;got really intense. They were not appreciating each other's&nbsp;skills and personalities at all. Later, they got along with each other and became really close friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-good-times><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Good Times</span></h2><p>It is said that when it' difficult to get something, and you finally get it, it becomes very dear to you. According to Paul, they have come a long way, and he learned a good lesson from what happened between he and Nina. He said an opinion about a person can change as fast as overnight. He said that happened to him. His opinion about his Vampire Diaries co-star, Nina Dobrev, really changed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Nina Dobrev And The Rest Of The Cast Have Said About TVD</a></span></p><h2 id=surprise-for-the-fans><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Surprise For The Fans</span></h2><p>The bitterness turning into sweetness came as a surprise to the fans. Of course, fans were longing to see them together in real life. According to Paul, they have become so close to each other now that they spend a lot of time eating out and watching movies. He feels quite happy about that. He is totally surprised by the fact that someone he didn’t approve of in the beginning has become such a good friend now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-bonding><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Their Bonding</span></h2><p>Now, the two actors not only share a strong rapport but also feel complete in each other’s company. Their tunes have changed so much that no one can believe that they were ever so indifferent to each other. After a lot of drama, they have become the closest of friends. They do not have a better friendship with anyone else from the show than they have with each other.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Sweet Facts About Elena And The Salvatores BTS Of The Vampire Diaries</a></span></p><h2 id=marriage-like-friendship><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Marriage Like Friendship</span></h2><p>Even the tiniest things about Paul used to annoy Nina and vice versa. Since they were together so much for work, it was just like a couple’s relationship at home. It was similar to couples being married and getting on each other’s nerves. They had a couple-like feud without actually being married. That was the exact opposite of what was happening on-screen.</p><h2 id=bringing-out-each-other-s-best-and-worst><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Bringing Out Each Other's Best And Worst</span></h2><p>There are celebrities who bring out either the best or the worst in their co-stars, on-screen or off-screen. But there's no drama if everyone gets along well and stays friends with each other. However, there are certain actors who are in complete awe of each other on-screen, and as soon as the camera switches off, their relationship transforms drastically, for the worse. Paul and Nina were like that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-polished-acting-skills-convinced-fans-about-their-romance><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Their Polished Acting Skills Convinced Fans About Their Romance</span></h2><p>It has been three years since the season finale of The Vampire Diaries and the&nbsp;on-screen chemistry of Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley is still being cherished by their fans. It was their polished acting skills and hard work which convinced the fans that they were crazy about one another.</p><h2 id=all-s-well-that-ends-well><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>All’s Well That Ends Well</span></h2><p>Contrary to the situation at the beginning of shooting, Paul and Nina are currently best friends, and Dobrev is also very good friends with Wesley’s wife. They also wanted to shut down the rumors surfacing about their hatred for each other. They've done so by sharing their adorable friendship on Instagram.</p><h2 id=shutting-down-feud-rumors-with-cuteness><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Shutting Down Feud Rumors With Cuteness</span></h2><p>Recently, Dobrev shared a video where Wesley approaches her and they hug.
