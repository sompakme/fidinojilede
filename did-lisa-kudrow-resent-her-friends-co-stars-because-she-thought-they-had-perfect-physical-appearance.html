She said something surprising: that <strong>she didn't feel great about her body while filming Friends</strong>. She mentioned that trying on Phoebe Buffay's clothes was tough, especially when she looked at Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox. However, she has never said that she disliked them because of this tough but relatable experience, and it doesn't seem like her feelings affected their relationship at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/9BA64EE2-EEA8-4AF3-ABBC-6B09E64A96E3.jpeg><p>According to Us Weekly, Kudrow said:</p><p>“It was just seeing myself on the show and seeing myself in clothes and seeing Courteney and Jennifer in clothes.

She said, “That’s when I would see, ‘Oh, OK, it’s not just about tailoring.’ And I’m not trying to say I was overweight, either. I was not. I just had no idea the shape of my actual body.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lisa-kudrow-admitted-there-was-a-time-in-which-hanging-out-with-matthew-perry-wasn-t-fun.jpg><p>In other interviews, Lisa Kudrow has shared that she loves her fellow Friends cast members.
