He has done a lot as a solo performer and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has also collaborated</a> a time or two. There is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a lot to know</a> about the talented singer, who went from solo gigs to landing a role on a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hit reality series</a>, and fans just can't get enough of him and his theatrical performances.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Bryan has been able to skyrocket his net worth over the years, and it has left many people wondering how he was able to pull this off. Sure, country artists have been known to do well for themselves, but Bryan is just on another level.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, how did Bryan accumulate his wealth? Let’s take a closer look at Bryan and how he built his empire!</span></p><h2 id=music-pays-the-bills>Music Pays The Bills</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>When discussing what Luke Bryan has primarily used to line his gigantic pockets over the years, the first place we have to look is at his music career. After all, it was in this arena that he was able to make a name for himself while locking down his initial fortune.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unlike other country artists out there, Bryan has been able to have a crossover appeal, which has led to him having multiple hits on the Hot 100, according to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Billboard</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. This is a tough undertaking for country music artists, and the genre itself can become quite niche at times. Despite this stigma, Bryan’s crossover appeal has helped him gain a wider audience while selling tons of records.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Over the years, Bryan has been able to sell <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over 7 million albums</a>, which is truly remarkable considering the streaming era that we are currently in. Some people still like to buy physical albums, and 7 million copies sold is nothing to scoff at.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>With millions of albums sold under his belt, it goes without saying that Bryan has also managed to haul in the big bucks while going on tour. A huge audience buying albums also means a huge audience that is going to show up to live shows for a night of entertainment. This has undoubtedly been a huge source of revenue for Bryan.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Music has done him well, and thanks to some business savvy, Bryan has leveraged his following into other money-making opportunities.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Daniel Radcliffe’s Net Worth Climbed To $112 Million Since Harry Potter’s Last Film</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=small-screen-fortune>Small Screen Fortune</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>While Luke Bryan used music to reach the top, it would be other ventures that would prove to be quite lucrative. Once he was on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>American Idol</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> as a judge, things truly hit another level for the singer.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The series itself has been a mainstay on television since the 2000s, and though it was gone for a hot second, it wound up coming back better than ever. Getting the right judges on board is incredibly important, and when it was announced that Luke Bryan was going to be taking part on the series, fans were ready to see what he would bring to the table.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Naturally, people were also curious about the money that he would be raking in each season. It has been reported that Luke has gotten paid <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$12 million</a> for a single season of the hit show. Now, this can be quite a demanding job, but this is a heck of a salary to be pulling down for appearing on television.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Luke was already doing well for himself on the music side of things, and his massive television salary truly took his career to another level. Turns out, he has other irons in the money-making fire.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Is Teen Mom Star Maci Bookout’s Net Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=his-buck-commander-empire>His Buck Commander Empire</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Luke Bryan has more than enough going for him at this point, but he is not the type of person to just settle for less. Outside of entertainment, Bryan has spread his wings into ventures that hit a little more close to his Southern roots.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Many people got familiar with the Duck Commander company thanks to the show </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Duck Dynasty</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> becoming a massive hit on television. Turns out, the boys from Duck Commander also had their eyes set on buck hunting, and Luke has been on board with Buck Commander for some time now. There are plenty of videos online that see Luke and the guys in the great outdoors, and it is interesting to watch him off stage and away from the limelight. Despite cameras being around, he seems like he is genuinely doing something for the fun of it.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Celebrity Net Worth</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Bryan is a co-owner of Buck Commander and makes money off of the gear that the company sells. With his name and the Duck Commander name attached to their products, one can only imagine how much gear they manage to unload each year.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Does Selena Gomez Spend Her $75 Million Net Worth?</a></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Not unlike other celebs, Luke Bryan has used a number of ventures to enhance his wealth.
