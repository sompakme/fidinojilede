Triple H is a student of the business, but he's still got his own little quirks.

He's Vince's son-in-law, and he's being groomed for the spot because he thinks in large part like Vince McMahon in terms of what a star is supposed to look like: a jacked-up bodybuilder. So, some things are not going to change. He's probably going to bring a more youthful approach to it, although [Triple H is] in his early 40s. So, he's not exactly youthful—but Vince is 66.</p><p>So, no: nobody's qualified to replace Vince. [Triple H] might do an okay job. But, personally, I think when General Patton [Vince] passes on, I think they're in trouble. [WWE is] always going to exist because they have a lot of money in the bank and they've grown into such a global company, but I don't think there's going to be any giant ground broken or revolutionary things done after Vince is gone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfpNwamxvXZ%2B2rnnCqKmnnaSpsm69zaiZqJypqHqywcCloJ%2BhlZl6tbuMq5yppJGYsm7CyKeanmWdmLqitM6nqA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
