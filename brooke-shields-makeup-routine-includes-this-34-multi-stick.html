If you’ve been doing your makeup for a while there’s no question that your routine has changed over the years, and that’s certainly the case for Brooke Shields. She’s spent a lifetime working in the fashion industry as both a model and a mogul, even launching her own skincare line! With her wealth of experience we definitely trust her when it comes to her beauty advice, and we’re dying to know how she manages to look so effortlessly beautiful at all times."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She’s spent a lifetime working in the fashion industry as both a model and a mogul, even launching her own skincare line! With her wealth of experience we definitely trust her when it comes to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">her beauty advice</a>, and we’re dying to know how she manages to look so effortlessly beautiful at all times.</p><p>Apart from a killer skincare routine, her secret is to keep her everyday makeup simple and natural. She revealed her go-to products in an <a href=# rel=noopener>interview with&nbsp;Vogue</a>, featuring one of our all-time favorite <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">multipurpose sticks</a> to give her complexion a gorgeous flush of color!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Multi-Stick</a> for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$34</a> at Ilia Beauty!</strong></p><p>Ilia Beauty’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Multi-Stick</a> is an award-winning product that we’ve been obsessed with since its launch, and Shields is also a massive fan! She describes her approach to makeup as a “less is more” type of deal, so we’re not surprised that this dreamy stick made it onto her roster. These creamy color pigments come in an array of beautiful rosy shades that can be used on the cheeks, lips and eyes. Just last year it took home a top prize in Allure’s&nbsp;beauty awards!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This product</a> is seriously easy to use and can become a part of your quick five-minute makeup routine. You can use a brush to dab on the color or apply it directly onto your desired areas and blend it in, using the warmth from your fingers to help melt it into the skin. In seconds your cheeks and lips can look perfectly flushed with color. The lighter shades can create a soft pink eyeshadow look, and the shimmery sticks are perfect highlighters for the high points of your face!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Multi-Stick</a> for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$34</a> at Ilia Beauty!</strong></p><p>Because of how well <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the Multi-Stick</a> blends into the skin it feels virtually weightless, which is perfect for the summer! We don’t like caking on powders that may melt away in the heat, so we prefer cream-based products like this one. When we’re not going for a full glam look and need to get our makeup done quickly, the Multi-Stick can get us ready and out the door seriously fast!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Multi-Stick</a> for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$34</a> at Ilia Beauty!</strong></p><p><strong>Not what you’re looking for?
