The Transformers star is seen as a prominent sex symbol in Hollywood, but has <a href=#>openly struggled with body dysmorphia</a>, a mental illness that distorts one’s view of their own body. Despite her widespread acclaim and status as a global icon of beauty, Fox’s internal battle with her body image has been a poignant reminder that public adoration does not equate to personal acceptance.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Denise-Richards-RHOBH.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Biggest Sex Symbols Of The '90s: Where Are They Now?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>What became of the rom-com leading men and drop dead gorgeous models who defined sex in the 1990s?</span><p>Adding to her challenges, Fox has pinpointed <a href=#>Hollywood as a catalyst for unhealthy beauty standards</a>, arguing that the industry has exacerbated her body image issues by constantly emphasizing her sex appeal. This relentless focus on her looks has overshadowed her own efforts to come to terms with her appearance. A common center of this focus has been on a specific physical condition that affects her thumbs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-rsquo-s-wrong-with-megan-fox-rsquo-s-thumbs>What’s Wrong With Megan Fox’s Thumbs?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/megan-fox-red-carpet.jpg><p>Megan Fox has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">condition known as brachydactyly</a>, specifically a variation referred to as a “clubbed thumb.” This genetic trait makes her thumbs appear shorter in comparison to her other fingers and overall body proportion. Brachydactyly does not usually hinder one’s ability to perform tasks with their hands or feet, as it typically presents only a cosmetic difference. For those like Megan Fox, whose daily activities are not impaired, medical treatment for this condition is not necessary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dr. Steven Bendner, a leading hand surgeon from New York, was quoted in The Sidney Herald, explaining <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Megan Fox’s ‘cosmetic deficit.</a>’ “Literally, what it means is short finger. The nail of the thumb in this condition is often very short and wide,” he said. “It is usually hereditary.” He continued to clarify that, “You need it to be able to touch the other fingers [as] it is important for pinching.”</p><p>“In Megan Fox’s case, it appears that only the last bone of the thumb is affected and that it does not involve the joint,” Dr. Bendner emphasized. “For her, it looks like it’s just a cosmetic deficit.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kylie-jenner-megan-fox-and-bella-hadid-setting-up-gofundme-pages-is-not-sitting-well-with-fans.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kylie Jenner, Megan Fox, And Bella Hadid Setting Up GoFundMe Pages Is Not Sitting Well With Fans</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Fans find it troubling that celebrities with massive net worths are setting up GoFundMe pages for their friends.</span><h2 id=what-critics-have-said-about-megan-fox-rsquo-s-thumbs>What Critics Have Said About Megan Fox’s Thumbs</h2><p>The conversation around Megan Fox’s thumbs gained momentum during the 2010 Super Bowl when she starred in a commercial for Motorola. In the ad, she takes a bubble bath and muses over the potential chaos that would ensue if she shared a photo using Motorola’s Moto Blur feature, which promises to update all of her social networks simultaneously. However, the award-winning actress soon found herself at the center of an unexpected debate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reports emerged, including one from Vulture, that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she had used a thumb double</a> for some shots in the commercial. The decision, whether made by Fox or Motorola, to replace her thumbs in close-up shots of the commercial, struck a dissonant chord, especially with people who also have brachydactyly. It seemed to suggest a discomfort with the appearance of clubbed thumbs, which could be seen as a negative message to those who share the condition.</p><p>Critics and viewers alike commented on the use of a thumb double, with many expressing disappointment and concern over what this implied about beauty standards in the media. One particularly harsh critic wrote on Reddit, saying, "Instead of all the plastic surgery she has had on her face, she should have had it on her thumbs instead.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/megan-fox-lost-out-on-millions-turning-down-the-role-of-lara-croft-so-she-souldn-t-be-compared-to-angelina-jolie.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Megan Fox Lost Out On Millions, Turning Down The Role of Lara Croft So She Wouldn't Be Compared To Angelina Jolie</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Despite a big offer, Megan Fox had a specific reason for passing on the Tomb Raider reboot.</span><h2 id=megan-fox-defended-herself-from-the-critics>Megan Fox Defended Herself From The Critics</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/megan-fox.jpg><p>In a candid conversation with Sports Illustrated for their 2023 swimsuit edition, Megan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox addressed her body dysmorphia</a> and paid particular focus on the peculiar public interest in her thumbs. She expressed bemusement at the fascination, stating, “I don’t know why people are so fascinated by my thumbs. I never thought that was a weird thing or an embarrassing thing. They’re just kind of short. Is it really that crazy?”</p><p>Fox, who has an interest in astrology, shared an intriguing tidbit linking physical traits to personality characteristics. “It’s known in palmistry as a ‘murderer’s thumb,’ because they say the shorter this area from the knuckle to the tip of the finger - especially the thumb - correlates to how short your temper is,” she explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite this, Megan Fox confessed to having “crazy patience,” though she humorously warned that once her patience runs out, the consequences can be intense. Moreover, she pointed out that she possesses other traits far more worthy of discussion: “I think I have tons of other flaws that are way more interesting than my thumbs. I don’t know why people focus on that.”</p><h2 id=have-megan-fox-rsquo-s-thumbs-affected-her-career>Have Megan Fox’s Thumbs Affected Her Career?</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><p>All things considered, it would be difficult to say that Megan Fox’s thumbs have affected her career trajectory. Enduring rumors have suggested that she is "blacklisted" from Hollywood due to <a href=#>her controversial comments about Transformers director Michael Bay</a>. Fox likened the filmmaker to Napoleon for his desire to cultivate a reputation as an “insane, infamous mad man.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=megan-fox-39-s-recent-roles>Megan Fox's Recent Roles</h3><table border=3 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Till Death (2021)</strong></p></td><td><p>Character: Emma Davenport</p></td><td><p>Released on VOD</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Midnight in the Switchgrass (2021)</strong></p></td><td><p>Character: Rebecca Lombardo</p></td><td><p>Box office: $97,518</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Johnny & Clyde (2023)</strong></p></td><td><p>Character: Alana Hart</p></td><td><p>Streaming on Prime Video</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>The Expendables 4 (2022)</strong></p></td><td><p>Character: Gina</p></td><td><p>Box office: $51 million</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Even so, Megan Fox has maintained a steady stream of work in the film industry.
