Mortimer and Kluth <a href=#>got engaged in November 2019</a>, shortly before <a href=#>she left the Bravo show</a> to move with Kluth to Chicago. They <a href=#>ultimately split</a> two years later.</p><p class=p1>“After fourteen months of engagement, Tinsley and I have ended our relationship, and we have been living independently for the last few months,” <a href=#>Kluth told <i>Us </i>in a March 2021 statement</a>. “This was an incredibly difficult decision, but it is one that I believe is best for both of us. I will always care about Tinsley, and I sincerely wish her happiness and success in all that she does in the future.”</p><p class=p1>Mortimer, however, <a href=#>allegedly felt “blindsided” by the breakup</a>. “Tinsley feels like she wasted four years of her life on Scott,” a source exclusively told <i>Us</i> at the time, claiming Kluth ended their engagement when she was at a photo shoot.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>A second source told <i>Us </i>that the writing had been on the wall because they had not “seen each other since the beginning of January” nor spent <a href=#>Valentine’s Day</a> together.</p><p class=p1>Mortimer was previously married to <strong>Robert Livingston “Topper” Mortimer</strong> between 2002 and 2010.
