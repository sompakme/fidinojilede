There’s no doubt that Cougar Town‘s <strong>Josh Hopkins</strong> has a chiseled six-pack worthy of the utmost envy, and on the season premiere of the TBS hit, his character Grayson’s abs are causing quite the stir. “I’m still annoyed at you for leaving the shower running again this morning,” Jules (<a href=#><strong>Courteney Cox</strong></a>) tells her husband while enjoying a glass of wine with her BFF Ellie (<strong>Christa Miller</strong>).</p><p>“He’s trying to make a home steam room because his gym membership got revoked,” Jules explains to Ellie in a preview scene from Cougar Town‘s January 7 premiere. Why’d he get the boot? No, not too much naked flexing, as Ellie surmises. “He got caught taking selfies,” Jules reveals, as her man proudly gestures to his six-pack abs and tells the women he intends to turn his iPhone pics into a coffee table book.</p><p>Later, with Grayson out of earshot, Ellie tells Jules she worries Jules may be on the verge of a breakdown, especially given the fact that her son, Travis (<strong>Dan Byrd</strong>), has started to date their pal Laurie (<a href=#><strong>Busy Philipps</strong></a>). “It sounds like you’ve got a full plate with your creepy vain husband and all the work you’re doing to try to pretend you’re cool with Trav and Laurie’s recent operation to have their lips sewn together,” Ellie says.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=366 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Josh Hopkins" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jules, however, isn’t willing to admit defeat. “[With] Trav and Laurie, yes, it was tough at the beginning, but the initial shock has warn off. I’m cool with it. Cool as ice!” she says, offering Ellie an enthusiastic high five.</p><p>Watch the hilarious clip above for telltale signs that Jules, as Ellie predicts, is not OK with her son’s new girlfriend before Cougar Town returns with new episodes Tuesday, Jan. 7 at 10 p.m. (EST) on TBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGoq5hitbC8yqKlrGWXp666v86nZK2Zm5rAbsDOqGSmmZ6uerSx17JkrJ2cm7amv4yopWabn6q0or6Mraawpl1nfXKAkWpm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
