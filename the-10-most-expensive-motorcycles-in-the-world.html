These two-wheeled <a href=#>engine-powered automobiles</a> have grown in popularity over the past few decades as their usage cut across personal adventure, sports purposes, etc. It is also why their demand has risen, as they continue to appeal to many young and fun-seeking individuals. While motorbikes may perform the same function, they differ from each other. Typically, factors like speed and durability are a few of what differentiates one motorbike from another and may influence a motorbike lover to buy one over another. However, in this article, we will look at the world's <a href=#>top ten most expensive</a> motorbikes, why they are expensive, and what makes them so unique.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ducati-testa-stretta-ncr-macchia-nera-225-000>Ducati Testa Stretta NCR Macchia Nera ($225,000)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ducati-Testa-Stretta-NCR-Macchia-Nera.jpg> Via Wikimedia Commons<p>At the World Ducati Week in 2004, the technology giant announced that it had launched the Macchia Nera series as its latest engineering magic at the time.

Its design was breathtaking and bespoke, and only 33 pieces were ever made. Despite its production phasing out, today it is an iconic item, which is still a <a href=#>possession for collectors</a>.
