On Monday (June 3), the Public Enemy leader jumped on X to share his thoughts on the role that some elder statesmen have played in promoting “dark energy” and nihilsm in their music, despite being of middle age.
“If you over 40, and spitting meaningless dark energy in rap, you have to really think about what matters in the hip-hop foundation that birthed your chance at it,” the esteemed emcee wrote."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A over 40 mind should have a better ability to KNOW self and surroundings better.

However, the 63-year-old has been particularly vocal in recent years, as he’s lamented the seeming distraction that rifts among rap artists have created.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Earlier this year, the Long Island native decried the idea that <a href=#>battle rap is a pillar of Hip-Hop</a>, arguing that it was spawned afterward and isn’t synonymous with the music or culture at its core. “Rap and Hip-Hop didn’t form from battle culture,” he wrote at the time. “It formed from party dance culture. The battle culture was a mutation alongside moving the crowd. The battle diss [sic] thing was a side evolution tumor. Started benign then ignorance made it malignant in the 90s.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See Chuck D’s X posts below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If you over 40 and spitting meaningless dark energy in RAP you have to really think about what matters in the HipHop foundation that birthed your chance at it</p>— Chuck D (@MrChuckD) <a href=# rel=nofollow>June 4, 2024</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I didn’t say cease and desist.
