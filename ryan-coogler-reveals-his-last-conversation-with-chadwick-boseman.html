I found out later that he was too tired to read anything.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Coogler also shares that while he was aware of Boseman’s diagnosis upon meeting him, he was ill-prepared to deal with <a href=#>the impact</a> his transition would have.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-megaphone wp-block-embed-megaphone"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“He was sick when I met him,” Coogler said. “But looking back on it, it’s like, my mans was dying. It’s a shocking thing to realize, and it’s also a thing where it’s like ‘I can’t quit.’ If he did all that while he was going through that, this is just grief. So we gotta push through.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">One spoiler the Cali native willingly allowed to slip about the upcoming Black Panther: Wakanda Forever film is that fans should not expect the return or portrayal of T’Challa by another actor, as Boseman’s performance and ownership of the role were unique to himself.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“He was T’Challa before Civil War in a way, in his mind,” Coogler said. “And I’m sure there’s a lot of actors like that out there like that. But they wasn’t Chad.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Black Panther: Wakanda Forever will hit theaters next Friday (Nov. 11).
