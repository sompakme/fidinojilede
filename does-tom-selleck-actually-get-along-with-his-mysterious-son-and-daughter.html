For that reason, fans typically know a lot about celebrities like Selleck and his peers.</p><p>As it turns out, however, Selleck has managed to keep some very important parts of his life away from the spotlight. Most notably, a lot of the people who've followed Selleck's career ever since he rose to fame know nothing about who the actor's children are.</p><p>Since little is known about Selleck's kids, it makes sense that some people aren't sure if he has a close relationship with them. Fortunately for anyone who wants to know more about Selleck's personal life, the nature of the actor's relationship with his kids seems pretty clear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-are-tom-selleck-39-s-kids>Who Are Tom Selleck's Kids?</h2><p>During most of Tom Selleck's career, it seemed pretty obvious that he didn't want to have his personal life in the spotlight. For that reason, it was pretty surprising when it was announced that Selleck was working on releasing a memoir.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Tom-Sellick-on-Blue-Bloods.jpg><p>Sadly, that memoir hasn't been published as of the time of this writing, so there is no way to know what he will reveal about his personal life in the book. Still, it is possible to reveal some basic facts about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who the actor's kids are</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tom Selleck Is Not Ready To Retire, But He Is Ready To Tell All</a></span></p><p>First off, there is Selleck's oldest child, his son Kevin. In 1971, Selleck married the model and actor Jacqueline Ray. After the couple walked down the aisle, Selleck adopted Kevin and to Tom's eternal credit, he continued to be a father to Kevin after he and Ray got divorced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/30D8AE18-9154-496C-920C-8115469D271D.jpeg><p>According to reports, Kevin was a part of the band Tonic from 1993 until 1996. During Kevin's tenure with Tonic, the band recorded their hit album "Lemon Paradise" which included the song "Open Up Your Eyes" and "If You Could Only See".</p><p>On top of his time with Tonic, Kevin also wrote a song that appeared on the soundtrack of the hit horror movie Scream 2. Kevin also appeared in a single episode of Magnum, P.I., his dad's beloved show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for Kevin and everyone who loves him, it has been reported that Tom's son has battled addiction issues. On the bright side, it was reported that Tom convinced Kevin to go to rehab, and he has been clean ever since.</p><p>After Kevin met and fell for a costume designer who now goes by Annabelle Selleck, the couple got married and reportedly had six children together.</p><p>In 1982, Tom's marriage to his first wife came to an unceremonious end. Several years later, Tom got remarried to a woman named Jillie Mack in 1987. During Tom's second marriage, he and his wife welcomed their daughter Hannah into the world in 1988.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hannah-selleck-horse-jumping.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once Hannah started to grow up, she developed a passion for horseback riding, and she eventually became an equestrian pro. According to reports, Hannah has won several medals in her sport of choice including at the 2010 Blenheim Summer Classic in California.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tom Selleck Has Been A Name In Hollywood For Years, But He Chooses To Live Life Off The Map On A 63-Acre Ranch</a></span></p><p>On top of her sports career, Hannah also founded Descano Farm, a horse breeding company. While speaking to Equestrian Living magazine, Hannah revealed what she hoped to accomplish with her breeding company.</p><p>“We want to show that we can produce horses in the States, having them on the ground as foals and bringing them up through the young horse classes. But we don’t want to just get the horse to the ring quickly; I want to make it right so that it has a long career.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hannah-selleck-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>Finally, Hannah has enjoyed a small amount of success as a model. While it seems clear that Hannah is dedicated to her company and sports careers, she has appeared on the cover of magazines like Palm Beach Illustrated, Equestrian Living, and Horse & Style.</p><h2 id=is-tom-selleck-close-with-his-kids>Is Tom Selleck Close With His Kids?</h2><p>Since Tom Selleck has mostly chosen to avoid talking about his kids during interviews and his memoir hasn't been released yet, his relationship with his children is somewhat mysterious. A perfect example of that is when his son reportedly was struggling with addiction issues, Tom never acknowledged the situation in public.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Tom Selleck's Marriage To Jillie Mack</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately for anyone curious about what Tom is like as a parent, some information has become publicly available as of this writing. Based on all of that information, it seems pretty clear that Tom is a loving and supportive parent who is dedicated to his kids.</p><p>According to a 2022 Closer Weekly report that stemmed from what an insider told the publication, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom is a "good dad" who was "close" with his children</a>. Furthermore, that report stated that Tom "will do absolutely anything for his son and daughter".</p><p>When Tom spoke to Parade in 2018, he remarked “You never stop being a dad even though your kids are grown.”</p><p>During Hannah Selleck's aforementioned Equestrian Living magazine interview, she mentioned the role her parents had in her becoming the success she is today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tom-selleck-and-his-wife-jillie-mack.jpg><p>“Because [my parents are] both artists, they believe in the idea that you have to be very passionate about what you do to be successful. They encouraged me to be passionate about it and immersed in it, and from there it was kind of on me how much I wanted it. They always let me take the lead. If I wanted to move barns or trainers, that was my decision.”</p><p>On top of supporting his daughter's horseback riding career, Tom has also been there for her horse breeding company. After all, according to reports, Tom has been involved in Descano Farm.</p><p>Based on all the available information, Tom appears to be a rock for both of his kids whenever they need him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdqLKtuMScomackaq0qcDEq2Ssp55iv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxec2ormg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
