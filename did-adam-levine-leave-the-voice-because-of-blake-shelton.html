The pop rock star won the first and fifth seasons of The Voice, with his Oklahoma-born compatriot winning every single installment in between.</p><p>Despite this fiery rivalry, the pair were believed to be very close friends off the screen. Even on the show, there were moments every now and then that demonstrated the beautiful bromance that existed between them.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Judges On 'The Voice' Have Revealed A Lot About How The Show Is Really Made</a></span></p><p>Adam and Blake were joined on <a href=#>the coaching team</a> by the latter’s future wife Gwen Stefani in 2014, when she came in to replace Colombian superstar Shakira for Season 7.

For me, it was time to move on. Your support has meant EVERYTHING.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was no official explanation given by Adam or NBC for why he was leaving. Unsurprisingly, this immediately gave way to a stream of rumors. There was a suggestion that <a href=#>he had in fact been fired</a>, and replaced by Kelly Clarkson.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Adam Levine And Other Judges From The Voice Have Said About The Show</a></span></p><p>Those rumors proved unfounded, and were actually first ignited by Blake Shelton during one episode in Season 20. There has been no evidence whatsoever to suggest that NBC might have been unhappy with Adam.</p><h2 id=was-blake-shelton-the-reason-adam-levine-left-the-voice>Was Blake Shelton The Reason Adam Levine Left The Voice?</h2><p>A few months after he officially left The Voice, Adam Levine appeared on <a href=#><strong>Ellen</strong></a>, where he explained his motivations for making the significant decision. Everything he said that day suggested that there was no bad blood between him and anyone on The Voice – including Blake Shelton.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In actual fact, Adam explained that he had just passed a particular threshold from his time on the popular reality series, and he needed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">focus more on his family</a>.</p><p>Asked whether he missed being on The Voice, the singer said: “I do miss it. But I also don't miss how much I had to work. I was just constantly working for so many years. [I was] very lucky, very fortunate, very blessed and all that, but [I wanted] just to be able to kind of stop at this moment to spend time with my new young family.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Look At Adam Levine's Life Outside Maroon 5</a></span></p><p>Adam also reminded everyone of his special relationship with Blake. “I really do miss [being on The Voice],” he said. “I love the people that I met and worked with, and obviously we all know how I feel about Blake.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-levine-also-gave-blake-shelton-a-shoutout-in-his-goodbye-message>Adam Levine Also Gave Blake Shelton A ShoutOut In His Goodbye Message</h2><p>That was not the first time that Adam Levine had name-dropped his unique friendship with Blake Shelton. In the farewell message that he posted on Instagram, he thanked all the coaches that he had worked with and competed against on The Voice, but he preserved a very special message for Blake.</p><p>“BLAKE F***IN’ SHELTON. I couldn’t hide my love for you if I tried. Seriously. I tried. Can’t do it. Our friendship is and always will be one for the books. Whatever this whole surreal experience was, I'm just happy I got to experience it with you,” Adam gushed.</p><p>The one other thing that fueled speculation about a possible strain in Adam and Blake’s relationship is the fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Maroon 5 star did not attend</a> his ex-colleague’s wedding to Gwen Stefani.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Neither Adam nor Blake and Gwen have given a concrete reason as to why he was absent, but the banter they have all shared regarding the subject would suggest that there is no animosity between them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdlrGiuYylnK%2Bhnpp6rbHAr5xmrJiaere7yJycZpqVmK62v8Rmpp9lkqGurLGMrJ%2BepKSku3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
