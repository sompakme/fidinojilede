Disney is all about that live-action hype right now. In fact, it has been for the past few years. And why wouldn't it be? Aladdin, The Lion King, and Beauty and the Beast's live-action remakes all grossed more than $1 billion each at the box office. That's why Disney's docket is fully loaded when it comes to its next few years of remakes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That's why Disney's docket is fully loaded when it comes to its next few years of remakes.</p><p>One of the more ambitious projects Disney has set up for itself is successfully giving Pinocchio the live-action treatment. This one may have to fall somewhere between the CGI overhaul of The Lion King, and the almost-completely CGI-less Beauty and the Beast. We're assuming the Beast wasn't played by a very hairy actor, and that his look&nbsp;had to be ever so slightly enhanced for that furry finished product.</p><p>RELATED:&nbsp;Hercules Joins Disney's Long List Of Promised Live-Action Remakes</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Pinocchio, Disney has an anthropomorphic wooden puppet to bring to life, as well as Jiminy Cricket, depending on how close to the original tale the movie sticks. However, there are also human elements to the movie, such as Pinocchio's creator, Geppetto. As for who will play the beloved carpenter, it appears that Disney has someone in mind.</p><p>The incomparable <a href=#>Tom Hanks</a>. In fact, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, Hanks as Geppetto is already pretty much nailed on. <a href=#>Robert Zemeckis</a> will direct the live-action remake, and the director and Hanks have a long and successful history together. Hanks and Zemeckis have worked together on Forrest Gump, Castaway, and Polar Express. It makes sense that they would be eager to work together again on this ambitious project.</p><p>Hanks has worked with Disney before, of course, lending his voice to one of its most famous characters. Toy Story's Woody. The Pixar division is one branch of the Disney tree untouched so far by the live-action fad. In its defense, not only might Pixar want nothing to do with it, but remaking any of its offerings so far under the live-action banner would be tricky. Up is the only one we can think of that might actually work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Britney Spears' Father Reacts To The #FreeBritney Movement</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e9OopGagkaO4tHnGnqepnaSpvG68yKemnJuYnrxw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
