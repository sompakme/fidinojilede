After all, we’ve all seen images of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rich pop stars</a> doing things like stepping out of limos, driving expensive cars, enjoying their massive estates, and performing for stadiums full of adoring fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, the most successful rock stars get to enjoy all of the same stuff that their pop performer peers are known for. Despite that, when a lot of people think about the way rock stars live, they think envision them giving in to the dangers of excess first and foremost. However, it should be noted that there are a lot of rock stars who are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">insanely rich</a>.</p><p>Throughout rock ‘n’ roll history, there have only been a handful of performers who’ve enjoyed success for decades. For example, Steven Tyler and Jon Jovi have both managed to remain in the spotlight for decades on end. With all of that in mind, it begs an obvious question, does Jon Bon Jovi have a higher net worth than Steven Tyler or vice versa?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Grohl's Net Worth Is More Than $300 Million: Here's How He Amassed His Fortune</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steven-rsquo-s-fortune>Steven’s Fortune</h2><p>In 1973, Aerosmith released their debut self-titled album and it became a surprise hit largely based on the massive success of its lead single, “Dream On”. After that initial success, Aerosmith would go on to enjoy a great deal of success with their follow-up albums. However, any perception that the band would put together a perfect string of success misses the mark as the group would hit the skids for a while.</p><p>In the past, Steven Tyler has spoken at great length about the fact that his life was ravaged by the scourge of addiction for many years. After getting himself straight, Tyler’s career still seemed to be on a downward slide. Then, everything turned around for Tyler and his band when Run-DMC released their version of Aerosmith’s classic song “Walk This Way”. Once the world rediscovered their love of Aerosmith after the release of Run-DMC’s single, the band went on to release four albums that contained thirteen Top 40 singles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the last two decades, Aerosmith has enjoyed a great deal of success as a touring band. However, when it comes to the new music the band has released, none of it has managed to make much of an impact. However, Steven Tyler has enjoyed some success in the entertainment business. For example, he served as an American Idol judge for two seasons and he appeared in several movies and TV shows. More importantly, Tyler and his bandmates made a fortune when they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">licensed their music</a> to the video game Guitar Hero: Aerosmith. Due to that deal and all of the other money Steven Tyler has made during his career, he has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$150 million</a> net worth according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Little Known Facts About Liv Tyler's Relationship With Her Dad, Steven Tyler</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bon-jovi-rules-the-roost>Bon Jovi Rules The Roost</h2><p>First formed in 1983, Bon Jovi has managed to enjoy so much success that it is hard to overstate how impressive the band’s legacy is. After all, the band is closing in on three decades of success and they seem to be going strong all of these years later.</p><p>Among the best-selling rock bands of all-time, Bon Jovi has released 15 studio albums, five compilations, and three live albums which is how they’ve sold more than 100 million records. Also a critical darling, Bon Jovi has been inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame and the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on top of winning a staggering amount of awards. Given everything the band has achieved, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that all of the group’s longstanding members are very rich.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bon Jovi Cancels Tour So That Fans Can Use Their Refunds For Essential Bills</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jon-rsquo-s-business-success>Jon’s Business Success</h2><p>Unlike a lot of his peers who’ve lost their shirts, Jon Bon Jovi has proven to be a masterful businessman. For example, a lot of Bon Jovi fans have no idea that the band has never had a record deal. Instead, Jon Bon Jovi has a record deal and the other members of Bon Jovi have been his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">paid employees</a> ever since the band first formed. Amazingly enough, all of the members of Bon Jovi seem to have no problem with this setup since Jon is so shrewd that they trust him. Of course, given that setup, it seems very likely that Jon makes more money from the band than anyone else.</p><p>On top of making a lot of money from music, Jon Bon Jovi has put together a successful and lucrative acting career for himself. For example, Jon memorably played a recurring role in the show Ally McBeal and he has appeared in many movies including U-571, Pay It Forward, and New Year’s Eve. Because of Jon Bon Jovi’s business acumen and his ability to entertain the masses, he has managed to amass a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$410 million</a> fortune according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bon Jovi Is Selling His Pad For $20 Million While He Humbly Washes Dishes And Feeds The Needy</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKZdl7yvecmoraJln6d6tMDEr5ynZaSuuaa%2BjLCfqGWYlsBurYyhoKCglad6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
