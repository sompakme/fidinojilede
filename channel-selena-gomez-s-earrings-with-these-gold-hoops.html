From runway shows to selfies on social media, you can catch the most notable A-listers rocking the classic staple. Most recently, Only Murders in the Building superstar <strong>Selena Gomez</strong> sported a dynamic pair, and of course, we were curious to find out more.</p><p>On October 10, the longtime mental health advocate <a href=#>announced on Instagram</a> her plans to donate a whopping 100% of Rare Beauty sales to support The Rare Impact Fund. In case you were unaware of her charitable pursuits, Gomez provides mental health resources and support to young people through the initiative. As usual, we were thrilled to hear about the multi-hyphenate’s philanthropic efforts — and naturally, we couldn’t help but notice the gold shining from her ears.</p><p>After digging, we found Gomez wore <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Pyra Large Hoops</a> from Mejuri. The popular brand is a favorite of celebs and influencers alike (plus Us!). While the gold hoops currently ring in at $148 — a relatively reasonable sum for such stunners — the price may be too steep for many budgets. If you’re looking to elevate your jewelry box for less, we found an excellent look-alike on Amazon — and it’s up for grabs with Prime shipping!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">KesaPlan Thick Gold Hoop Earrings</a> for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$14</a> at Amazon!
