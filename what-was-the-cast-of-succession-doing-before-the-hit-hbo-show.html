Every actor on the show is known today for their roles on the popular show, but what were these actors doing prior to Succession? Here’s a look at what each cast member was doing before stepping into the Roy family saga.</p><h2 id=alan-ruck><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Alan Ruck</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you’re tuning into Succession for the first time you may find the character of Connor Roy to be a very familiar looking actor. So called “Con-heads,” the endearing nickname in the Succession universe for fans of Connor Roy, may like him for his politics and taste in hyper decanting wine. But before Ruck landed the role as the eldest and least dramatic of the Roy children he was a well known actor from the 80’s. His most notable film character is Cameron Frye, who is the best friend of Ferris Bueller in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Ruck also starred in the ABC sitcom Spin City.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Are Matthew Broderick's Most Iconic Roles (Other Than Ferris Bueller)</a></span></p><h2 id=matthew-macfayden><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Matthew Macfayden</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before he married into the Roy family, actor Matthew Macfayden was best known for courting and marrying another famous woman.

Macfayden and Knightley also appeared in the film adaptation of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Karenina.</a> Fans of Succesion are used to seeing Macfayden play the comedic role of Tom Wambsgans, but prior to the hit HBO show Macfayden was best known for his dramatic roles and period pieces. He is a trained London stage actor, working for theatre companies including the Royal Shakespeare Company, Cheek by Jowl, and the Royal National Theatre.</p><h2 id=kieran-culkin><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kieran Culkin</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a child actor, Kieran Culkin appeared in classic films like Father of the Bride, The Cider House Rules, and The Mighty.
