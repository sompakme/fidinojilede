Certain people blame me for the shootings at schools. I think my numbers are low, and hopefully,&nbsp;they go up on this record. That’s going to be a great pull-quote for you. But, honestly, the Columbine era destroyed my entire career at the time.”</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>THE MOST SHOCKING RUMORS ABOUT MARILYN MANSON</a></strong></p><p>He goes on to explain that in the years following the shootings, people would boycott and picket his concerts, plus he received multiple death threats on a daily basis.</p><p>Despite constantly defending himself and refuting claims that he had any association to the killers, his career never fully recovered. The horrific actions of Harris and Klebold appeared to overshadow anything that <a href=#>Manson </a>had to say. Even after he fought back against the haters very eloquently in Michael Moore’s documentary Bowling For Columbine, public opinion of him did not seem to waver at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While promoting his new album Heaven Upside Down, which is set to drop on Oct. 7, 2017, Marilyn Manson is blaming the Columbine tragedy for ruining his career. However, it is not as though the singer was chased out the business and completely disappeared. He is still making music and has acted in numerous roles over the years. There is no doubt that being falsely associated with what happened in Colorado had an impact on his career, but is the incident really to blame for Manson’s low record sales?</p><p>What do you think, is Manson right or wrong about Columbine and his career?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3yurdGio7KmXaKur7%2FOp2Scp5yquqO1zZ5kraqRnLKlxYyrrKKmmaO0bq%2FAq5yeql8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
