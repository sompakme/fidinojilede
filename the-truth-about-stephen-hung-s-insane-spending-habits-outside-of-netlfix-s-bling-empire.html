One of the truly incredible things about Stephen is the outfits he wears when he leaves that massive home.</p><p>After all, Stephen likes to wear expensive and colorful clothes designed by the likes of Jean Paul Gaultier, Versace, Gucci, and other big brand fashion labels. Of course, Stephen is far from the only person who can wear clothes from those labels. However, Stephen stands out because he reportedly only wears clothes he has labels like those <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">make custom for him</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/stephen-hung-and-deborah-hung-s-custom-clothes.jpg><p>From the outside looking in, there is no way to know how expensive it would be to have huge labels make custom clothes.

In that piece, the reporter describes a meeting that Stephen took with Arnaud Bastien, Graff Diamonds' Asia president and chief executive.</p><p>According to what Bastien said to The WSJ's reporter, Stephen regularly made big money purchases from Graff Diamonds.

However, Stephen's purchase is still incredible no matter who he intended the cars for.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/stephen-hung-in-front-of-a-rolls-royce-phantom.jpg><p>"But these beauties are not for Hung to drive.
