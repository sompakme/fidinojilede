The 30-minute video shows an emotionally distressed Woods fighting to regain control. During the interview with close family friend Jada Pinkett-Smith, Woods admitted to making a few mistakes that night in question, but she is not the cause of Khloe Kardashian and Thompson’s separation, as the former alleged on Twitter immediately following the episode’s release."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Her friends were later invited to a party hosted at the NBA star’s mansion.</strong></h3><p>“Sunday night, I went to dinner with some friends and I went to this bar after, there was a party going on… Tristan was there he was doing his own thing,” she recalled. “That was it. Normal L.A. culture go to a bar, go to a club, it ends early, you go to a house after. We are not thinking about who’s house… The&nbsp;group of girls that I am with are saying that they want to go to a house…&nbsp;They are saying it’s Tristan’s&nbsp;house… He didn’t even invite me there.”</p><h3><strong>She claims that she never gave Thompson a lap dance, nor did she make out with him or leave the public area where the after-party was taking place.</strong></h3><p>“Never once was I giving him a lap dance, making out with him, sitting all over him,” she said. “It’s just we are all together, we are in a group. Never once did [Thompson and I] leave the public area, go to a bedroom, go to a bathroom, we’re all in plain sight.”</p><h3><strong>Woods believes that the rumored lap dance she gave Thompson was because they were seen sitting closely together.&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>“Now this seems completely&nbsp;crazy to me that anybody says there was a lap dance involved, because&nbsp;there was no lap dance involved,” she told Pinkett-Smith. “But what I can think as to why someone would&nbsp;say that… there was a chair here, a couch, and then another chair, so he is sitting in this chair and… I am sitting on the arm of the chair… there is no way it would look like a lap dance, but I could see why people would think, ‘they are getting cozy.'”</p><h3><strong>Thompson allegedly kissed Woods as she was leaving his place after partying with him and others.&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>“On the way out…[Thompson] did kiss me,” Woods said.</p><p>“What do you mean by kiss?” Pinkett-Smith asked.</p><p>“No passion, no nothing on the way out. He just kissed me,” she explained. “No tongue kiss, no making out, nothing.”</p><h3><strong>Woods chose not to tell Kylie Jenner and Khloe Kardashian that Thompson kissed her because she knew their relationship was already experiencing turmoil.</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>“I went home. I had talked to Kylie and Khloé in the morning and I told them I was there,” she explained. “And I had talked to Khloé and she asked me ‘what’s going on, is everything fine?’ And in my head of trying to forget that part of the story, I was just like, ‘…He was chilling everything was okay. There were girls there but he wasn’t all over the girls.'”</p><p>“What exactly were you not honest about?” Pinkett-Smith asked.</p><p>“I was honest about being there but I wasn’t honest about the actions that had taken place,” Woods said.</p><p>Immediately following the episode premiere, Khloe Kardashian responded to Woods’ claim, calling her a liar, and stating her belief that she is the reason that Thompson and herself are no longer together.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Why are you lying <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@jordynwoods</a> ??
