When it comes to beauty products, most of the time it’s a game of trial and error to discover when works best for you. A product that works great on one person might react bad to your skin, or not match your complexion. It might not live up to your expectations or be worth the expensive price tag, in your opinion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That’s why it’s important to read the reviews! Tons of shoppers have taken the time to share their honest opinions online at Sephora to caution or encourage others before buying a product. You’d be surprised to know what products didn’t work out for people, and the reasons why. Likewise, you’d probably be surprised by the hidden gems to be found in Sephora if you just do a little bit of research.</p><p>We’ve rounded up the best 12 products and the worst 12 products you can find at Sephora, according to the reviews. This is a reason to always do your research ahead of time to ensure you’re getting the most bang for your buck. You don’t want to spend so much money just for it to be a flop!</p><p>These are the best of the best and the worst of the worst. The best ones are used by the likes of Khloe and Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, Hailey Baldwin, Katie Holmes, and Zendaya and many customer reviews. The ones that are useless are deemed that way because of customer reviews, while celebs don't bother picking them up at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=best-too-faced-hangover-replenishing-face-primer-21>Best: Too Faced Hangover Replenishing Face Primer ($21)</h2><p>A primer is just a primer, right? Well, not after you try this legendary primer from Too Faced!</p><p>This product promises to leave your skin smooth and bright for a flawless makeup application. Its infused with coconut water to help revive tired looking skin and improve its luster. It also delivers much-needed hydration to the skin, which helps improve complexion in the long run.</p><p>All in all, reviewers say this is their number one primer for keeping makeup looking good all day long. “This keeps my skin feeling moisturized all through the day, keeps my makeup from caking in my dry areas, and my makeup stays in place all day,” one shopper wrote online.</p><h2 id=useless-fenty-beauty-galaxy-eyeshadow-palette-59>useless: Fenty Beauty Galaxy Eyeshadow Palette ($59)</h2><p>Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty has taken the world by storm after launching only a little more than a year ago. But there’s one product you need to watch out for!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reviews for Fenty Beauty’s Galaxy eyeshadow palette haven’t been so kind. The limited-edition palette features 14 star-dusted shades that include satin finishes, glitter top coats, and smoky mattes. Despite how beautiful they look in the packaging, the quality with the eyeshadow is allegedly just not there.</p><p>“The shadows aren’t pigmented at all. It’s just a huge glittery mess. And they fade super quick,” one Sephora shopper <a href=#>reviewed</a>&nbsp;online. “No matter what primer, setting spray, wet brush etc. thing I try, it just doesn’t work.”</p><h2 id=best-kat-von-d-alchemist-holographic-palette-44>Best: Kat von D Alchemist Holographic Palette ($44)</h2><p>When does Kat Von D ever disappoint us? The answer: never!</p><p>People have been raving about her alchemist palette ever since it came out. You can easily highlight all the high points of your face with this fun highlighting palette, and of course, customize your color by mixing the four shades together. The formula’s prismatic coating reacts with light for the ultimate holographic effect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The shades are very creamy but also easy to work with, and more wearable than you'd expect,” one fan <a href=#>reviewed</a>. “I love using these as inner corner highlights for an interesting pop of colour, or the green and pink shades particularly as cheek highlights.”</p><h2 id=useless-glamglow-supermud-activated-charcoal-treatment-75>useless: GlamGlow Supermud Activated Charcoal Treatment ($75)</h2><p>GlamGlow has an amazing reputation of making fun skin masks that actually work. However, some Sephora shoppers have noticed one of their masks that doesn’t work as well as the rest.</p><p>The Supermud Treatment is supposed to visibly change and clear your complexion, but many people have complained that it causes unbearably dry skin. “It works for spot-treating,” one reviewer <a href=#>wrote</a>. “But when I try to use it on my whole face, it's as though it undoes ALL the dry skin treatments I have done for months and months. Hellooooo skin flakes!”</p><p>It’s best to spend your money on a mask you know is trustworthy and will work!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=best-nars-velvet-lip-glides-34>Best: Nars Velvet Lip Glides ($34)</h2><p>Nars is one of the best makeup brands out there, so it’s no surprise that they’ve come up with one of the best formulas for liquid lipstick.</p><p>Their velvet lip glides offer a smooth, semi-matte finish while still managing to hydrate the lips, making it wearable all day. It comes in a variety of flattering shades, from pinks to reds to browns.</p><p>“Formula is smooth, not tacky, and it truly does glide on the lips – it’s like a hybrid of a lipstick and gloss,” one customer said online. “Love the color selection and the pigmentation in the lippies is very rich. Wear time isn’t bad and I like the stain it leaves on my lips.”</p><h2 id=useless-becca-prismatic-amethyst-shimmering-skin-perfector-46>useless: Becca Prismatic Amethyst Shimmering Skin Perfector ($46)</h2><p>Becca is known to be the Queen of highlighters, so we had high hopes when they came out with this feminine, pinky-purple highlighter. It features duo-chrome pigments that help capture the light as you move, giving the most perfect, natural glow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While many reviewers admitted the product is beautiful both on and off the skin, the biggest problem is that it’s not wearable on a day-to-day basis. “I think I fell for the marketing of this product, and the fact that amethyst is my birthstone,” one Sephora user <a href=#>said</a>. “The colour isn't wearable all the time. I've only used it once since I purchased it.”</p><h2 id=best-kevyn-aucoin-neo-limelight-in-ibiza-75>Best: Kevyn Aucoin Neo Limelight in Ibiza ($75)</h2><p>Kevyn Aucoin is a legend in the beauty world. You might be paying a small fortune for one of his products, but it’s well worth the price!</p><p>And that’s why we bet the Neo Limelight in Ibiza highlighter is so well reviewed. It’s a trio of three radiant, highly-pigmented shades, so you can customize your look however you want. It wears perfectly all day and is easy to blend, so you won’t have to worry about fussing over your highlighter anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“This was so freaking expensive but so worth,” one Sephora shopper <a href=#>wrote</a>&nbsp;online. “Despite the white gold-pink-purple gradient, this looks subtly luminous and even natural on the skin. It can be an everyday highlighter, or built up for that ethereal fairy glow.” (Source: Community.Sephora)</p><h2 id=useless-burberry-fresh-glow-luminous-fluid-base-54>useless: Burberry Fresh Glow Luminous Fluid Base ($54)</h2><p>When you buy a Burberry product, you’re expecting great quality. But, according to Sephora reviews, this is one Burberry product that is a total dud.</p><p>This multi-use primer promises to leave you with a glowy, dewy complexion, but customers have said that it only leaves their skin feeling dry and in need of serious hydration. “My skin, which normally looks pretty good, instantly looked like a parched, fuzzy desert the second this touched my face,” one Sephora user <a href=#>wrote</a>.</p><p>They added, “I tried to carry on and do the rest of my makeup, but this was so bad that I gave up halfway through, washed my face, and completely started over. Never again.”</p><h2 id=best-gerard-cosmetics-slay-all-day-setting-spray-34-80>Best: Gerard Cosmetics Slay All Day Setting Spray ($34.80)</h2><p>Move over Urban Decay All Nighter, there’s a new setting spray in town!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gerard Cosmetics is an up-and-coming makeup brand, but be prepared to hear a lot about them if this setting spray is any indication. This setting spray is specifically formulated to control the amount of oil produced, and will leave you with a matte, flawless look. The spray is unscented, which is a big plus according to online reviews.</p><p>“I own soooooo many setting sprays but this one I buy in bulk. It sets makeup better than anything I’ve ever used!!!” one shopper wrote online, revealing it’s their holy grail product.</p><h2 id=useless-benefit-s-they-re-real-lengthening-amp-volumizing-mascara-32>useless: Benefit’s They’re Real! Lengthening & Volumizing Mascara ($32)</h2><p>It can be tough finding a mascara that works for your lashes, but it sounds like this tube from Benefit might be one to steer clear from.</p><p>Benefit’s They’re Real! Mascara has been around for some time. Its breakthrough bristles promise to lift and separate your lashes in a way you’ve never seen before, for the ultimate length and volume.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, despite all the hype surrounding it, many customers have complained it only leaves their lashes looking spider-like. “Makes my lashes clump together and is impossible to take off (similar to waterproof mascara, but it's not waterproof),” one shopper wrote online. “I'm gonna finish the tube, but I'll be glad once I can toss it.”</p><h2 id=best-marc-jacobs-air-blush-soft-glow-duo-57>Best: Marc Jacobs Air Blush Soft Glow Duo ($57)</h2><p>If you’re looking for the perfect touch of blush for your beauty look, then try this beloved product from Marc Jacobs.</p><p>Their Air Brush is famous for being easy to blend and having the perfect amount of pigment. It features two shades that blend together so you can customize your look for the perfect finishing touch of color. Its weightless design means it’s comfortable and easy to wear all day long.</p><p>“These blend sooo easily and last so long on the face. I wanted these from day 1 and finally bought these 3, and I'm so happy I did,” one reviewer <a href=#>raved</a>&nbsp;online.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=useless-urban-decay-s-naked-heat-palette-66>useless: Urban Decay’s Naked Heat Palette ($66)</h2><p>Warm-toned colors have been all the rage recently, so tons of beauty gurus went wild when Urban Decay introduced their Naked Heat Palette. Like all of the Naked palettes, it features an assortment of shimmery and matte shades as well as a variety of hues, so it’s easy to create a day look and then transition it to night.</p><p>The main complaint most shoppers have against this palette is it doesn’t compare to their other luxury eyeshadow palettes, so they never reach for it. “I really do like the shades but I just find that I reach for single shadows and cream shadows more,” one shopper wrote online. “I need to make more of an effort to use this because, like I said, it really is a nice product.”</p><h2 id=best-drunk-elephant-lala-retro-whipped-cream-75>Best: Drunk Elephant Lala Retro Whipped Cream ($75)</h2><p>Drunk Elephant is quickly becoming one of the leading skincare brands- and this product is the reason why!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Advertised as a ‘retro-style moisturizer,’ Drunk Elephant claims this is the best product for dry, dull skin that’s in major need of a facelift. It promises to provide a solution to dryness, loss of firmness and elasticity, and even fine lines and wrinkles.</p><p>“At first try I thought this was sooo thick, but it really isn’t!” One Sephora user wrote, explaining you need to give it a fair chance. “Sinks right into skin and hydrates all day especially in a cold Canadian winter climate. Does not break me out or make me oily (I have breakout prone combo skin).”</p><h2 id=useless-algenist-hydrating-essence-toner-30>useless: Algenist Hydrating Essence Toner ($30)</h2><p>This toner has a hefty price tag when compared to alternatives, which is why customers expect it to stick to its&nbsp;promise of leaving your skin feeling refreshed, softer, and brightened. It claims to help balance the skin’s moisture levels, and help rid it of dirt and grime.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, people who have purchased this product say it does anything but- some people even claim it caused them to have break-outs. “Felt like water, definitely not hydrating, and did nothing but break me out,” one Sephora user <a href=#>wrote</a>. Perhaps this is a sign you should save your money and spend it elsewhere!</p><h2 id=best-tom-ford-ultimate-bronzer-in-terra-138>Best: Tom Ford Ultimate Bronzer in Terra ($138)</h2><p>Become a glowing goddess with this beloved bronzer from Tom Ford!</p><p>Like any Tom Ford products, this bronzer comes with a very hefty price tag. But evidently, its quality makes it well worth the price. This bronzer promises to blend easily and feel weightless on the skin, meaning you won’t have to worry about harsh streaks or it melting off during the day. And the best thing? It works for all skin types!</p><p>“I have dry skin and often have issues with bronzer looking patchy on my forehead near my hairline,” one happy customer <a href=#>wrote</a>. “This is so smooth and lasts a long time on the skin, and the color is perfect for me. I also like how it's impossible to over apply it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=useless-christophe-robin-regenerating-mask-with-rare-prickly-pear-seed-oil-89>useless: Christophe Robin Regenerating Mask With Rare Prickly Pear Seed Oil ($89)</h2><p>Pear sounds like a nice smell for a mask right? Well, many Sephora shoppers claim this mask would be a lot better if they’d chosen another scent.</p><p>This mask Christophe Robin claims it uses rare prickly pear seed oil to help repair and nourish damaged hair, leaving it soft and voluminous. It’s specially formatted to be suitable for colored hair, and also helps tame frizz and split ends.</p><p>However, most people can’t get over the rancid smell, which they claim lingers in your hair even after washing it out. “It smells disgusting to me. And has this linger to it as well,” one user <a href=#>wrote</a>. We don’t care how soft it makes our locks- we don’t want stinky hair!</p><h2 id=best-kat-von-d-tattoo-liner-25>Best: Kat Von D Tattoo Liner ($25)</h2><p>Once again, Kat Von D is slaying the makeup game!</p><p>Makeup gurus all claim that this is one of the easiest liners to apply and is also one of the longest wearing ones. It delivers a high-pigment wing that promises to stay put all day without running, cracking, or melting. The super fine tip allows for easy application, meaning you can finally achieve a cat eye look on the regular!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Most liquid liners are a bit more difficult to work with than pencil liners,” one shopper reviewed online at Sephora. “But KVD liners are so freaking easy to use that I use them even when I only have a few minutes to get ready!!”</p><h2 id=useless-farsali-rose-gold-elixir-67>useless: Farsali Rose Gold Elixir ($67)</h2><p>Similar to their Unicorn Elixir, the Rose Gold Elixir, which is a fast-absorbing, dry oil, by Farsali promises to replace your daily moisturizer. The rose gold-infused oil contains valuable vitamins and fatty acids to restore the look of your complexion and improve skin texture while helping with makeup application.</p><p>Despite its bold promises, many customers have said it was a let-down compared to Farsali’s other products. “I had high hopes based on my love of Unicorn Essence, but it was NOT the same - super oily and not as glowy or bubble gum scented,” one person <a href=#>reviewed</a>&nbsp;online.</p><p>This is one oil you can definitely pass on!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=best-uma-oils-ultimate-brightening-face-mask-70>Best: Uma Oils Ultimate Brightening Face Mask ($70)</h2><p>If you’re looking for the perfect glow, then look no further than this brightening mask from Uma Oils!</p><p>This mask claims to drastically change the complexion of your skin thanks to its combination of spices, which will bring fresh blood to the top layer of the skin to clear up imperfections. It promises to deliver a rush of Vitamin C to the skin, which will further hydrate it and prevent further damage.</p><p>One reviewer claims this product instantly leaves their face feeling more glow-y! “Talk about glow when you take this off. It lasts for days,” they <a href=#>wrote</a>. “I love this when I have an event I need to be glowy for, or if I'm feeling a little dull.”</p><h2 id=useless-philosophy-purity-made-simple-cleanser-15>useless: Philosophy Purity Made Simple Cleanser ($15)</h2><p>Philosophy is widely known for their great selection of skincare, but it looks like not all of their products stand the test of time. The Purity Made Simple cleanser claims to be good for all skin types, and is an easy way to tone and hydrate your skin in one step. They even advertise it as ‘award-winning’ on the Sephora website.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though this product is supposed to prevent breakouts, many shoppers reported suffering from acne after a few uses. “For me, it irritated my skin and caused breakouts,” one person <a href=#>wrote</a>, though they acknowledge the product still has a devoted following. If you have sensitive skin, then we’d think about giving this product a hard pass.</p><h2 id=best-eminence-licorice-root-booster-serum-56>Best: Eminence Licorice Root Booster Serum ($56)</h2><p>If you’re looking to improve the complexion of your skin, then look no further than this serum from Eminence.</p><p>It promises to drastically improve the look of your skin- and online reviews claim it works! With regular use, you’ll begin to see smoother, calmer, and firmer skin that feels more moisturized and healthier. This serum promises to brighten and clear up the face, leaving you with a nourished glow.</p><p>“I have some stubborn sunspots and hyperpigmentation from a few acne scars that I've been working on clearing up and this product has helped immensely,” one review <a href=#>says</a>. “I was surprised to see results as quickly as I did but my skin just loves this stuff.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=useless-tarte-amazonian-clay-24-hour-foundation-51>useless: Tarte Amazonian Clay 24-Hour Foundation ($51)</h2><p>Tons of Youtubers and bloggers in the beauty community have raved over the Tarte Amazonian Clay Foundation. Too bad the online reviews aren’t as kind!</p><p>This long-lasting foundation claims it will stay on the skin for at least a full day, and provide full coverage. Its weightless design promises to make it comfortable on the skin, despite providing seamless coverage. Sounds like a dream come true, right?</p><p>“It was recommended to me by an employee and it was awful for my dry skin and just felt like a tight mask on my face,” one reviewer <a href=#>wrote</a>, shattering our dreams that this is the perfect foundation. “I read later that it’s a better foundation for oily skin types.”</p><h2 id=best-clinique-moisture-surge-overnight-mask-46>Best: Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask ($46)</h2><p>Clinique is known for excelling in the skincare department, so no one should be surprised that they have on of the best masks on the market. This oil-free mask promises to give you soft, dewy skin by the morning, and penetrate the skin with hydration to repair signs of aging and damage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And, according to Sephora shoppers, it actually works!</p><p>“This has lasted me such a long time! I have switched between quite a few night moisturizers and somehow I always come back to this one,” one happy customer <a href=#>wrote</a>. “The hydration it provides to my extremely dry skin overnight is miraculous. Will definitely repurchase.”</p><h2 id=useless-whamisa-sea-kelp-sheet-mask-20>useless: Whamisa Sea Kelp Sheet Mask ($20)</h2><p>Sheet masks can do no wrong, right? Think again!</p><p>This sea kelp sheet mask from Whamisa claims to bring much-needed moisture through the skin thanks to its all-natural ingredients, and also helps to clear and brighten your complexion.
