The film based on the band of the same name. Val&nbsp; spoke with Oliver Stone early on, concerned about what he might want to do with the story because he&nbsp; didn’t believe in or want to promote substance abuse.</p><p>He saw Morrison as having picked the wrong heroes, who had different issues, that were not part of the creativity or inspiration. He also saw Morrison’s story as one that could be told “a thousand different ways” and didn’t want to tell it by playing the role in the style of drugs, with which Oliver Stone agreed.</p><p>He memorized the lyrics to all of lead singer Jim Morrison’s songs prior to his audition, and sent a video of himself performing some Doors songs to director Stone. However Stone was not impressed with the tape, but Paul Rothchild (the original producer of The Doors) said “I was shaken by it” and suggested they record Val in the studio. After Kilmer was cast as Morrison, he prepared for the role by attending Doors tribute concerts and reading Morrison’s poetry.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=val-kilmer-2017></span><span>Val Kilmer 2017</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Val&nbsp; appeared in Song to Song in 2017,opposite Rooney Mara and Ryan Gosling and directed by Terrence Malick.&nbsp; He also appeared in the 2017 film,The Snowman opposite Michael Fassbender and Rebecca Ferguson and directed by Tomas Alfredson. It was confirmed on June 7, 2018 Val would be reprising his role as Lt. Tom “Iceman” Kazanski for the upcoming Top Gun sequel Top Gun: Maverick.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=val-kilmer-batman></span><span>Val Kilmer Batman</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Batman Forever director Joel Schumacher in December 1993 he had seen Tombstone and was most impressed with Kilmer’s performance as Doc Holliday. He felt that Val to be perfect for the role of Batman, though at the time, the role was still Michael Keaton’s. Keaton in July 1994 he decided not to return for a third Batman film after 1992’s Batman Returns, due to “creative differences”. William Baldwin who previously worked with Schumacher on Flatliners was reported to be a top contender, though just days after Keaton dropped out,Val was cast.&nbsp; He took the role without even knowing who the new director was and without reading the script.</p><p>Batman Forever was released in June 1995. It was a success at the box office, despite receiving mixed reviews from critics. There was debate about Val’sperformance: some critics, like The New York Times’ Janet Maslin, thought Kilmer was a poor successor to Keaton in the part;&nbsp; while others, such as Roger Ebert, had kind words for him. Bob Kane Batman creator&nbsp; said in a Cinescape interview that of all the actors to have played Batman up to that point, he felt Val had given the best interpretation. Leonard Maltin film critic&nbsp; who criticized the dark tone contained in Batman Returns complimented val’s portrayal when he reviewed the film for his expanding collection of film reviews.</p><p>Batman Forever defenders praised the film for portraying Batman as a more heroic, less ruthless, and more human character than in the Tim Burton films. This film also brought the film interpretation of Bruce Wayne more into line with his comic book counterpart, showing him as a socialite and a very public figure rather than the neurotic recluse of the previous films. Val in February 1996 he decided not to return for another Batman feature film, feeling that Batman was being marginalized in favor of the villains.&nbsp; and because of their scheduling problems with The Saint. Val was replaced by&nbsp;George Clooney as Batman in 1997’s Batman & Robin. There were also reports that Val had not had a good working relationship with Schumacher, as another reason for not reprising the role.</p><h1 style=text-align:center><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Val Kilmer</span></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-val-kilmer></span><span>Who is Val Kilmer?&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He is an accomplished American actor, musician, and artist.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-val-kilmer></span><span>How old is Val Kilmer? <i>&nbsp;</i></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He is&nbsp;on December 31, 1959, in Los Angeles USA.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-val-kilmer></span><span>How tall is Val Kilmer? <i>&nbsp;</i></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>He </strong>stands at a height of 1.82 m.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-val-kilmer-married></span><span>Is Val Kilmer married? <i>&nbsp;</i></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, He married actress Joanne Whalley and they were together from March 1988 to February 1996.
