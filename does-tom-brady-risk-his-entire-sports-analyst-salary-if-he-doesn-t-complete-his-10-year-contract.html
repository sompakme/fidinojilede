While fans know that athletes can only put their bodies through so much, there's something about Brady that makes him seem powerful and invincible.</p><p>Although <a href=#>Brady lost money from a bad cryptocurrency deal</a>, he maintains a <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $300 million</a> </strong>and has <a href=#>paid millions for yachts</a>. Now that Tom Brady has retired, he <strong>signed a $375 million 10-year contract with Fox Sports </strong>to be a sports analyst. However, some people think that he won't actually see that through. In this article, we'll take a look at how much money the athlete would get if he doesn't finish the contract, along with why he wanted to retire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-brady-could-lose-most-of-his-375-million-fox-sports-salary-if-he-leaves-before-the-10-year-contract-is-up>Tom Brady Could Lose Most Of His $375 Million Fox Sports Salary If He Leaves Before The 10-Year Contract Is Up</h2><p>In March 2024, The Daily Mail reported that Richard Deitsch, a media analyst, <strong>doesn't think that Tom Brady will finish his 10-year Fox Sports contract</strong>. On the podcast Sports Media with Richard Deitsch, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">talked about this impressive contract</a> and said:</p><p>"I'd bet all the money I own that Tom Brady will not complete the Fox contract.

However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Brady's contract</a> works out to an <strong>annual salary of $37.5 million</strong>, according to Sporting News. If the athlete only stays at Fox Sports for a few years, he will earn that salary, so he is still looking at a huge payday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/here-s-what-happened-to-gisele-bundchen-s-net-worth-post-tom-brady.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Here's What Happened To Gisele Bündchen's Net Worth After Tom Brady">Here's What Happened To Gisele Bündchen's Net Worth After Tom Brady</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Gisele Bündchen's net worth is surprising, especially given how famous (and rich) her ex-husband Tom Brady is.</p><p>However, some reports say that Tom Brady won't join Fox Sports at all, which would likely mean that he wouldn't receive any of the money.

Brady made the official announcement in February 2023.
