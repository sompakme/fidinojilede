However, their recent endeavors don't just stop there. While Kourtney Kardashian launched Poosh in 2019, Kylie has also expanded her Kylie Cosmetics empire to introduce Kylie Baby and Kylie Skin, while Khloe has continued to work on Good American.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kim has most recently rebranded her original KKW Beauty completely to SKKN.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="How Much Money Has Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty Line Made?">How Much Money Has Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty Line Made?</a></span></p><h2 id=why-did-kkw-beauty-change-to-skkn>Why Did KKW Beauty Change To SKKN?</h2><p>Many fans have been left wondering what happened to Kim's much-loved KKW beauty, which earned the reality TV star millions in revenue per year alongside <a href=#>her lucrative SKIMS line</a>. Before re-launching the brand, Kim took to Instagram to announce that KKW was officially closing in order to expand into new and sustainable directions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for many fans, this means that her KKW beauty items are no longer available for purchase unless they can find a reseller.</p><p>However, fans needn't worry — Kim's already launched a new beauty line called SKKN, and it looks like it's the replacement for KKW Beauty. However, what was the reasoning behind such a drastic business move from the reality TV mogul?</p><p>On a recent podcast episode of “Not Skinny But Not Fat” with host Amanda Hirsch, Kim opened up and revealed the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">real reason why she chose to rebrand</a> her beauty company (and it's not <a href=#>because her divorce from Kanye changed her name</a>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the podcast, she stated the following reasons for the rebrand, “What I really wanted to do was, I felt so bad that the customer had to go from KKW Beauty, then would go to KKW Skin, then would go to KKW Fragrance — that’s shipping costs at three different websites. And I felt so bad. And then Skims, you know what I mean? So I wanted one beauty brand.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="How Many Of The Kardashians Are Actually Vegan (And What Do They Eat?)">How Many Of The Kardashians Are Actually Vegan (And What Do They Eat?)</a></span></p><p>It looks like the Keeping Up star is also set to make the same move with her fragrance company, with her KKW Fragrance business page posting a statement to announce that they will be closing the website to launch under a new brand name. The statement also put an emphasis on the fact that fans will be able to "purchase from all beauty categories under one site".</p><p>It looks like this may be part of the bigger picture for SKKN by Kim, however, it has not been officially confirmed yet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-do-fans-feel-about-kim-rsquo-s-new-skkn-products>How Do Fans Feel About Kim’s New SKKN Products?</h2><p>So far, it seems that all the products on the site have received quite impressive reviews, although more time will be needed to gather an overall picture of how these products stack up.</p><p>All the products have received at least four stars in terms of customer reviews, with most of them sitting around 4.5 stars out of 5 — quite an impressive rating. Despite the price, it seems that customers so far think that the products are good value for money.</p><p>Beauty reviews have been generally positive, although some have noted that some products are a little pricey and that fans can get cheaper alternatives. However, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">doctor's review of the products</a> was a little more critical and revealed which products were not worth the money alongside highlighting the good ones.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Kim Kardashian Shows Off Her Metallic Swim Collection On Instagram">Kim Kardashian Shows Off Her Metallic Swim Collection On Instagram</a></span></p><p>Not everyone will love the brand, especially when it comes to the bottom line.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-skkn-by-kim-cost>How Much Does SKKN By Kim Cost?</h2><p>Though SKKN apparently holds sales occasionally, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pricing for beauty bundles ranges</a> from under $200 to well over $600. Clearly, for the average consumer, that's a steep price. While fans who swear by Kim's beauty prowess likely won't balk at the prices, others aren't impressed.</p><p>There's been some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">online backlash from beauty enthusiasts</a> who say Kim's out of touch with reality when it comes to her pricing. However, the price bump doesn't seem to have impacted SKKN sales, and it may not; anything KarJenner branded does seem to perform well in the marketplace.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# title="8 Times Kim Kardashian Was Trolled For Allegedly Photoshopping Pictures">8 Times Kim Kardashian Was Trolled For Allegedly Photoshopping Pictures</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dqLisuoypqaicpZjBtHnWqKmtoF2lv6qvxGaioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
