Fans Have Some Theories</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-07-08</div><p>Fans have watched The Kardashian family grow up on their screens ever since the launch of Keeping Up With The Kardashians in 2007, regularly tuning in to watch the family drama unfold. Packed with family feuds and relationship drama, the series quickly became one of the most popular reality tv series to ever be aired on the E! Network channel. Since its launch, each family member has become highly popular on social media, amassing millions of followers on each of their social media accounts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One family member who has become notably successful is one of the youngest sisters in the family, <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>. While all the sisters have been incredibly successful in their own right, Kylie has always managed to create a buzz among the Gen-Z audience. In November 2015, she launched Kylie Cosmetics, her very own makeup brand. Since then, she has gone on to release an array of noteworthy collections. But what does her day-to-day life actually look like?</p><h2 id=kylie-became-famous-at-a-very-young-age>Kylie Became Famous At A Very Young Age</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Kim-Kourtney-Khloe-Kardashian-with-Kris-Kylie-and-Kendall-Jenner.jpg><p>When Keeping Up With The Kardashians first aired in 2007, Kylie Jenner was just ten years old, while her sister, Kendall, was slightly older at eleven years old. Thousands of fans from across the globe witnessed a young Kendall and Kylie growing up in front of their very eyes, which allowed for some enjoyable and funny moments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, while fans loved watching the two young reality stars grow up on camera, there are <a href=#>some moments that Kylie has admitted that she finds rather embarrassing</a>, such as the episode involving a stripper pole, which she now wishes had never aired.</p><p>Due to leading such a busy lifestyle during her adolescent years, Kylie ended up being homeschooled. While her mom clearly thought that it was the best decision for her two younger daughters, <a href=#>Kylie has revealed that she wasn't very fond of the final decision</a>.</p><p>In an episode of Life Of Kylie, she revealed that she missed out on social activities and other normal teen activities, adding that 'it just made her really sad'. Judging by this comment, it seems as though Kylie missed being able to hang out with her friends and take part in normal activities with them growing up.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Kylie Jenner And Kourtney Kardashian Praised For Unfollowing 'Love Rat' Tristan Thompson">Kylie Jenner And Kourtney Kardashian Praised For Unfollowing 'Love Rat' Tristan Thompson</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, what does her day-to-day life look like now she has blossomed into a young adult? While the show gives a small preview of the fashion mogul's personal life, fans have developed their own theories.</p><h2 id=fans-theorize-she-now-lives-a-somewhat-relaxed-lifestyle>Fans Theorize She Now Lives A Somewhat Relaxed Lifestyle</h2><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie has made occasional appearances on the new The Kardashians series</a>, many fans have been left wondering what she gets up to behind the scenes.</p><p>After becoming a mother, she appears to of kept much of her life private, most likely for her own personal reasons. However, this hasn't stopped nosy fans from coming up with their own theories, with the fashion mogul's absence creating more curiosity than ever. So, what exactly do fans think Kylie gets up to in her day-to-day life?</p><p>Fans took a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> thread to discuss their ideas, with a variety of opinions being shared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One fan aired their opinion, writing: "Sleeping in, getting her makeup/hair/nails done, light exercise, eating expensive food, hanging out with her kids and kris/corey, shopping, scrolling on her phone. Living the dream life tbh (minus having 2 kids)."</p><p>Another theorized, "Idk. I get the sense that since she lost Jordyn she has no REAL best friend and her friend group now is sort of loose and unimportant. I think the kids are the only thing tying her to this earth at all. I think she does more normal mommy stuff than some might think."</p><p>Other fans echoed similar opinions, theorizing that she probably spends a lot of time looking after her children. Many fans also added that she probably spends a lot of time doing 'beauty upkeep like morning skincare routine, work out', with some adding that she probably spends a lot of time taking selfies and going through glam.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Does Kylie Jenner's BFF Stassie Come From A Rich Family?">Does Kylie Jenner's BFF Stassie Come From A Rich Family?</a></span></p><p>Most of the comments seemed to revolve around the star living a more leisurely lifestyle, rather than being based around constantly working.</p><h2 id=some-fans-feel-sorry-for-kylie>Some Fans Feel Sorry For Kylie</h2><p>However, not all fans on the thread seemed envious of her lifestyle. Some pointed out that they may find the way she lives quite lonely, and that it actually sounds 'quite dull'.</p><p>Other fans expressed their sympathy towards Kylie, and seemed to feel sorry for her. One fan commented: "I think her life is probably really sad and lonely tbh. Right now she’s bonding with her new baby and trying to play house with Travis even though he belongs to the streets."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="9 Of The Best Looks From The Kardashians On Hulu">9 Of The Best Looks From The Kardashians On Hulu</a></span></p><p>Another stated: "Wow this thread is depressing.
