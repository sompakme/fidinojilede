While they were each in the movie, they split the role of Julian.</p><p>It wasn’t until Disney Channel’s <a href=#>The Suite Life of Zack & Cody</a> that Dylan and Cole started to branch off and play separate roles. The duo shot to superstardom for their portrayal of <a href=#>twin brothers Zack and Cody</a> from 2005 to 2008.</p><p>The show’s success was not lost on the actors, with Dylan later attributing much of <a href=#>his and Cole’s growth</a> as individuals to the series.</p><p>“A lot had happened in our lives that was difficult then and this show, in a way, saved us. 1000 years of gratitude to all involved,” Dylan <a href=#>wrote via Instagram in March 2020</a> in celebration of the 15-year anniversary of the show.</p><p>The <a href=#>My Fake Boyfriend actor</a>, who was <a href=#>only 11 years old</a> when the series began, added: “I love you all and I’m glad this show can still give families the nostalgia they once had when watching it. I’ll keep those memories forever.”</p><p>Cole, for his part, echoed his brother’s sentiments about <a href=#>the Disney show</a> in May 2021, confessing that it’s his not-so-guilty pleasure when drinking.</p><p>“When I’m drunk or feeling really narcissistic, yeah [I put it on],” he said during an episode of <a href=#>Vogue’s “73 Questions”</a> at the time. “I don’t really like to watch anything I do. So, I try to stay away from it.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Riverdale</a> star added: “I know it sounds cheesy [but] I still have a really deep fondness for The Suite Life.” He recalled, “When I graduated middle school, the crew threw a big graduation. I cried on screen.”</p><p>The siblings, who took <a href=#>a break from Hollywood to go to college</a>, have yet to reunite for a project since their Disney Channel days. Dylan, however, hasn’t ruled out an onscreen comeback with Cole.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s more likely that I will write something for us to work in together, rather than someone approach us,” the beermaker <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in February 2020. “Twin movies are never good! That’s just the universal truth I think the universe has given to us, and so if we can find the right thing then, yeah.”</p><p>Scroll down to relive the Sprouse twins’ ups and downs over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksLC4xGaqqaqfqsCmecOyo5qmXai9s7vUrJxmrJinvLazx2aroZ1drrKivtJmqq6hpJp6rbXFnmSmp6KafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
