Skovbye, 29, played Austin’s widow, Missy McMurray, who still lives on the ranch after his death.</p><p>While Rosner’s character is only shown in flashback sequences, he has a soft spot for the show and his former castmates.</p><p>“Tiera Skovbye and I got fairly close. I would definitely love to do something with her [again],” Rosner shared. “Then <strong>Sara Garcia</strong> … I cast her in a rom-com last year. We did a Christmas movie under my company. She was fantastic in that. So [I] have worked with Sarah and I would love to work with Tiera.”</p><p>Ride premiered in March 2023 and followed the McMurray family as they struggled to keep their Colorado ranch and overcome the loss of Austin. Matriarch Isabel (Nancy Travis) runs the ranch alongside her two remaining sons, Cash (Beau Mirchoff) and Tuff (Jake Foy), as well as daughter-in-law Missy.</p><p>Hallmark <a href=#>canceled the cowboy drama</a> in November 2023. The following month, The CW announced that it was picking up the <a href=# rel=noopener>10-episode show</a> to air on its network beginning in January. A second season of Ride was never greenlit.</p><p>Although Rosner told Us he’d love to revive his Ride character, he also revealed that he’s willing to travel just about anywhere to keep working with Hallmark.</p><p>“Let me be crystal clear, if there’s any Hallmark producers out there that are making an abroad movie, I will come work for free,” he teased. “I love traveling and I love acting, obviously. And to get to do them at the same time is a dream.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Falling-Like-Snowflakes-Marcus-Rosner-Jokes-He-Had-to-Work-to-Be-Professional-With-Costar-Rebecca-082.jpg><p>Rosner recalled previously working in Budapest for Hallmark’s Love on the Right Course alongside <strong>Brittany Bristow</strong> and <strong>Ashley Newbrough</strong>, calling the project “one of the best filming experiences of my life.”</p><p>While he didn’t travel outside of Canada for his latest Hallmark movie, <a href=#>Falling Like Snowflakes</a>, Rosner had fond memories of filming the “Christmas in July” film.</p><p>“I actually really bought into that story,” Rosner told Us of the holiday rom-com, which follows photographer Teagan (<strong>Rebecca Dalton</strong>) and her ex Noah (Rosner) as they hunt for an elusive snowflake to photograph for a local art gallery. “These movies always attach themselves to a unique niche part of society that you probably don’t know much about, and you get to learn about that while also enjoying pretty people falling in love.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The actor noted, “I loved the science aspect of hearing the odds of these snowflakes [coming together],” referring to his character’s journey with Tegan to find a 12-sided snowflake, which only happens when two six-sided snowflakes crash into each other’s orbit and combine.</p><p>“I was like, ‘Oh, that’s actually really cool,’” Rosner recalled. “It’s a great metaphor for what we’re doing here.”</p><p>Falling Like Snowflakes premiered on Saturday, June 29, while Ride is available to stream on Hallmark Movies Now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSaqpOqwG6%2Bzqylnqpdna60ecidnJpllqS%2Fbr7InZxmoJGhua6t0aRkoaecnrGixYympq%2BhlWK9s7HQrpylZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
