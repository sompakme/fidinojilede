“We obviously [were] professional and kept it that way.

However, I felt as though it’s almost like there was this layer because he and I kind of knew this secret thing that nobody else knew,” Cassidy <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly in June 2023</a> while promoting the film. “And we could let our guard down when our characters were supposed to and allow space to fall into one another. I almost feel like that added a certain type of element to it. We just couldn’t help it.”</p><p>Despite having an instant attraction, Cassidy told Us she was hesitant to work closely with another “pretty Canadian [and] really attractive” actor “named Stephen.” She previously starred opposite Canada native <a href=#><strong>Stephen Amell</strong></a>, whom she called a “brother,” on The CW’s <a href=#>Arrow</a> from 2012 to 2015 as Laurel Lance/Black Canary and later Black Siren from 2016 to 2020. (Huszar, for his part, is a Canadian actor known for his role as Luke Tatum on <a href=#>Hallmark’s Chesapeake Shores</a>.)</p><p>Cassidy, however, pushed her reservations aside and found herself under Huszar’s spell in part due to their mutual connection to crystals. The twosome officially hit it off during one of their A Royal Christmas Crush scenes before <a href=#>going public with the relationship in May 2023</a>.</p><p>“I remember there’s this one scene in the barn where I literally am looking at him, and that was the moment for me. I’m not kidding you. I’m, like, leaning on the table and he’s saying his lines and I just like, I think I like almost fell over,” Cassidy recalled to Us, sharing that she and Huszar later realized they first began falling for each other “30 seconds apart’ while filming the “same scene.”</p><p>Scroll down to see Cassidy and Huszar’s love story from the beginning:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/March-2023-Katie-Cassidy-and-Stephen-Huszars-Timeline-From-%E2%80%98A-Royal-Christmas-Crush-Costars-to-Dating1.jpg><h2><strong>March 2023</strong></h2><p>Cassidy and Huszar began filming Hallmark’s A Royal Christmas Crush.

Huszar, for his part, explained to Us, “It’s certainly important to keep it professional.
