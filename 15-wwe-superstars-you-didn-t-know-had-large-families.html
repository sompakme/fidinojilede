For the first time this year Monday Night Raw will be streamed live on Christmas Day and SmackDown Live will be on Boxing Day. Some of these wrestlers are able to juggle lives in the spotlight as well as personal lives where they have a large family to look after. All of the superstars who make up the following list have either three or more children who have been forced to grow up watching one of their parents on TV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, some of these stars are able to have time away on personal leave so that they can see some of the biggest moments in their children's young lives, but this could be a huge problem for a number of these wrestlers, since they have more than one child, which would be much harder to manage along with their hectic touring and travelling schedule. The following is a list of 15 WWE stars you didn't know once did or still manage to juggle a career with WWE as well as a hectic personal life.</p><h2 id=jake-the-snake-roberts>Jake "The Snake" Roberts</h2><p><a href=#>Jake "The Snake" Roberts</a> is a WWE Hall of Famer and a legend in wrestling circles but he has always had a problem with addiction. Roberts started drinking alcohol at an alarming rate when he was just a teenager and over the past few decades, this has taken its toll on him. After numerous&nbsp;bouts of ill health, Roberts was able to return to the WWE back in 2014 before he was inducted into the Hall of Fame later that year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At 62 years old, Jake has relied on the support of his family over the past few years, a family that consists of eight children and ten grandchildren. Jake's oldest daughter was born back in 1975 just months after he married his first wife.&nbsp;He went on to have twin sons with Karen Rauschuber before their marriage ended in divorce. Robert then married for the second time in 1984 and had two children with his second wife Cheryl before they were divorced in 1997. He later went on to have three more children with his current partner&nbsp;Jesse Mitchson.</p><h2 id=candice-michelle>Candice Michelle</h2><p>Candice Michelle will be best remembered in WWE as a former Playboy cover girl, Diva Search contestant, and then later Women's Champion. Candice was the first woman to take part in the Diva Search and later go on to win the Women's Championship, but it seems that this wasn't enough to keep her in WWE for a lengthy period of time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michelle was released from her WWE contract back in 2009 and hasn't returned to the company since. Instead Candice focused on creating a family with her husband&nbsp;Ken Gee Ehrlich, who she married back in 2005. Less than a year after Candice was released, she welcomed her first daughter called&nbsp;AkiAnne Rose, her second daughter&nbsp;Ryumi Grace followed in 2012, before it seems that Candice's family was complete when&nbsp;Aloha Von was born back in the summer of 2015. Candice&nbsp;recently officially retired from wrestling when she defeated Victoria at a House of Hardcore match in her home state.</p><h2 id=william-regal>William Regal</h2><p>William Regal was once the only British superstar in WWE, but even though he retired from the ring a number of years ago, he can still be seen regularly on TV as the General Manager of NXT.</p><p>Regal is thought to have been one of the best technical wrestlers of all time and even though he spent a lot of time on the road throughout his career, Regal was still able to create a family during his younger days. Regal married&nbsp;Christina Beddoes back in November 1986 and the couple has three sons called Daniel, Bailey, and Dane. It seems that pets are the thing that has taken over Regal's life over the past few years with his current animals including two snakes, eight lizards, a tortoise, three cats, and two dogs. Regal himself once admitted that he has so many animals because he doesn't like humans very much, but it seems he liked Christina enough to start a family with her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alberto-del-rio>Alberto Del Rio</h2><p><a href=#>Alberto Del Rio</a> is a former World Champion in WWE but his personal life has made more headlines than his professional career over the past year since he was part of a very public relationship with former Divas Champion Paige. Before the couple revealed that they were in a relationship back in the Spring of 2016, Del Rio was in a secret relationship with current SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte.</p><p>Del Rio was still married to his first wife Angie throughout his public relationship with Paige which forced her to later file for divorce when it was clear that he was committing adultery. Del Rio and his wife have three children whom Del Rio was able to maintain contact with throughout his relationship with Paige, since she often talked about how much she enjoyed having them around. Del Rio was released from WWE back in September 2016 and has since been working on the Independent Circuit.</p><h2 id=mick-foley>Mick Foley</h2><p><a href=#>Mick Foley</a> will always be seen as the hardcore legend that he once was throughout his time in WWE, but more recently he was seen as the General Manager of Monday Night Raw until he was fired ahead of WrestleMania this year and replaced by <a href=#>Kurt Angle</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Foley has always been a family man and this was proven throughout Holey Foley on the WWE Network, a show that centred around Mick and his family. Mick married his wife Colette back in 1992 and together the couple welcomed their first son called Dewey later that year. Noelle was born a year later in 1993, almost a decade later their third child Mickey was born in 2001, and Hughie then followed in 2003. Both Dewey and Noelle have done work for WWE over the past few years, which is why they are the best-known children of the Foley clan.</p><h2 id=brock-lesnar>Brock Lesnar</h2><p>The current Universal Champion may have a lot of heat in the WWE locker room right now when it comes to the fact that he has a part-time contract despite being the main champion on the Raw brand, but who can argue with <a href=#>Brock Lesnar</a> if he wants to spend more time with his family and WWE will allow it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brock was once engaged to Nicole McClain, and the&nbsp;two welcomed twins called Mya and Luke during their time together but it seems that their relationship didn't work out since he later went on to marry former Women's Champion Sable back in 2006. Lesnar and Sable have two sons together that were born back in 2009 and 2010 respectively. Lesnar is also the stepfather to Sable's oldest daughter whom she had from her first relationship back in the early 1990s, which means that between them the&nbsp;two have five children to look after.</p><h2 id=christy-hemme>Christy Hemme</h2><p>Christy Hemme was the first winner of the Diva Search that was given a contract to be part of WWE TV back in 2004 and she went on to become a popular addition to the roster before she was shockingly fired less than two years later. Hemme has since made a name for herself as both a wrestler and ring announcer for Impact Wrestling over the past few years but has seemingly retired from the wrestling business recently since her first child was born.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Christy married Charley Patterson back in January 2015 and the couple then welcomed their first daughter called Charlie Rose in September this year. Hemme then made the shocking announcement that she was expecting&nbsp;quadruplets back in October. Hemme even went as far as to announce the names for her children,&nbsp;who will be born in 2018. They will be called&nbsp;Hemme Lee Patterson, Jagger James Patterson, Quinn Eugene Patterson, and Sunni Sue Patterson.</p><h2 id=bobby-roode>Bobby Roode</h2><p>The "Glorious" <a href=#>Bobby Roode</a> has been around the wrestling business for a number of decades now but has only recently been able to join WWE and be promoted to their SmackDown brand after a successful stint in NXT. Roode is perhaps best known for his time in TNA, where he became one of their biggest stars.</p><p>Despite spending the best part of the last decade on the road living his dream, Roode has still been able to put down roots and start a family. Roode married his wife Tracy back in 1995 and together the couple has three young sons called Robert, Riley, and Nicholas. Roode still spends a lot of time on the road as part of the main roster in WWE but he has been able to manage his time wisely and uploads a number of images to his Instagram page to show that he still makes time for his children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-undertaker>The Undertaker</h2><p><a href=#>The Undertaker</a> has been a solid force on the WWE roster for almost 30 years so it seems somewhat impossible for him to have been able to juggle a family as well as being one of the biggest stars of the last generation, but it seems that The Phenom truly is that since he hasn't just been able to juggle a family, but he's been able to find time to be part of quite a big family.</p><p>Undertaker married his first wife Jodi back in 1989 and the couple welcomed their first son Gunner in 1993. The marriage later ended in divorce and allowed Undertaker to move on to marry Sara Frank back in 2000. The couple had two daughters together, Chasey who was born in 2002, and Gracie who arrived in 2005. The former World Champion's second marriage was over by 2007 so he moved on to marry former Women's Champion Michelle McCool back in 2010 and the couple welcomed their first daughter called Kaia Faith back in 2012.</p><h2 id=aj-styles>AJ Styles</h2><p>AJ Styles is widely considered to be one of the best wrestlers in the world right now, but it seems that the current WWE Champion is another superstar who has been forced to juggle a wrestling career and a personal life over the past few years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Styles came over to WWE after a successful stint in TNA, but it was revealed that Styles could have been signed by the company a few years earlier if it wasn't for the fact that he didn't want to ruin his wife's college education. Styles married his wife Wendy who is a school teacher back in 2000 and together the couple has four children. The former United States Champion has three sons called Ajay, Avery and Albey and a daughter called Anney.&nbsp;All of this children have the initials AJ and have their names tattooed on their father's ribs under his huge AJ tattoo.</p><h2 id=corey-graves>Corey Graves</h2><p>Corey Graves is a former NXT Tag Team Champion who was forced to hang up his wrestling boots for good a few years ago when it was reported that the former NXT star could no longer compete due to an injury. Since then WWE has been able to find a place for him behind the commentary desk, a place&nbsp;where he has been able to excel and become one of the best commentators in the company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Graves could have been released from the company when it was revealed that he could no longer actively compete but WWE decided to allow him to switch to commentary, which worked out quite well for him since he has a family to support. Graves married Amy Polinsky back in 2000 and together the couple has three young children.&nbsp; Graves has a boy and two young girls and somehow still manages to fit in time to see his family alongside his busy schedule.</p><h2 id=karl-anderson>Karl Anderson</h2><p>Karl Anderson made his WWE debut back in 2016 when he was signed to the company after a stint in NJPW as part of The Bullet Club. Anderson is a former Raw Tag Team Champion and even though he is rarely used on the Raw roster right now, the company&nbsp;is well aware that he has won titles all over the world and is one of the best tag team wrestlers that they have at their disposal.</p><p>Anderson has bragged a number of times about how he has a "hot Asian wife" but he has been able to keep her out of the headlines throughout his career, which means that her name still remains a mystery. What is known is that the couple has been married now for around a decade and have three sons together. Anderson has uploaded a number of images online that show that his sons are all still quite young.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-jericho>Chris Jericho</h2><p><a href=#>Chris Jericho</a> has to be some kind of Superman, there is no doubt about it. Not only has Jericho been able to manage a successful wrestling career alongside touring regularly with his band Fozzy over the past few years, but he had also been able to juggle family life as well. Even though Jericho has been involved in his own fair share of scandals over the past few years, his wife Jessica Lockhart has remained by his side throughout.</p><p>The couple married back in 2000 and they have three children together.&nbsp;The former World Champion has a son called Ash who was born back in 2003 and twin daughters called&nbsp;Sierra Loretta and&nbsp;Cheyenne Lee who were born back in 2006. Jericho often allows his children to join him as guests on his Talk is Jericho podcast and is happy for them to be known to the public.</p><h2 id=the-rock>The Rock</h2><p>The Rock was the face of The Attitude Era in WWE before he was able to successfully switch the ring for the silver screen when he was cast in The Mummy more than a decade ago. The Rock has remained loyal to the business where he first found fame and often returns to the company when executives think that ratings need a boost.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though The Rock has one of the busiest lives on this list, it seems that he has still found time to start a family, twice over. The former WWE Champion married his first wife Dany Garcia back in 1997 and the couple welcomed their daughter Simone Alexander in 2001. The couple divorced back in 2007 and The Rock began dating Lauren Hashian.&nbsp;The couple announced the arrival of their first daughter together called Jasmine back in 2015 before they revealed this past week that they are expecting their second daughter together and The Rock's third in 2018.</p><h2 id=roman-reigns>Roman Reigns</h2><p><a href=#>Roman Reigns</a> is one of the biggest stars in WWE right now as the man that many feel is the leader of The Shield and the current Intercontinental Champion. As well as being on the road 300 days a year it seems that Reigns also has a family to support outside of the company. It was well-known that Roman had a daughter called Joelle since she appeared on WWE TV as part of Roman's feud with Bray a few years ago, but it seems that Roman has been able to keep his other children a secret.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Roman has never been a man who liked his family being in the spotlight, but he married his wife Galina Becker back in 2014 when their daughter was eight-years-old. His wife later gave birth to twin boys back in 2016 and it seems that Roman has tried to protect his sons from the public eye as much as he could over the past year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6toaWVixLixjKysqZ2iqMGivtJmsKitXZm2pbrTZqKnp6ditaKwjKWYq5%2BVYrOiuciloJ6rXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
