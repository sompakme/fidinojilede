He has always been someone that has been in my corner and has rooted for me. Things started getting more romantic after this girls’ trip that I went on. He made me feel heard and seen. Those were feelings that I hadn’t really felt ever,” she gushed on the&nbsp;Wednesday, May 31, episode. “I think I was living in my own little reality hoping it would work out.”</p><p>Raquel claimed that Sandoval’s then-girlfriend, <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a>, “never pressed” them about any suspicions about their affair. “She never confronted me about it. From what I know — from what Tom told me — she didn’t question him too much about it,” she told Andy. “She just believed this at face value. Now I know that she did want to know and it was very deceitful. I am very ashamed of it.”</p><p>Part 3 of the special will show what happened when Raquel jointed the cast of the hit reality series at the taping in late March, weeks after <a href=#>news broke about Raquel and Sandoval’s affair</a>, to address the scandal. Amid the public backlash, the former beauty pageant contestant took to social media <a href=#>to issue an apology to Ariana as the affair led</a> to her split from Sandoval.</p><p>Raquel went onto say that <a href=#>she was “speaking to a counselor” about her personal issues</a>, writing via Instagram at the time, “I have sought emotional validation through intimate connections that are not healthy without regard for my own well-being, sometimes negatively affecting others and often prioritizing the intimate connection over my friendships. I am taking steps to understand my behavior and make healthier choices.”</p><p>Before the reunion taping, the model <a href=#>recalled growing closer to Sandoval amid his romance</a> with Ariana.</p><p>“It started off as a friendship and turned into something more,” she told TMZ in March. “We’re just trying to get through these next through steps and make amends and hear everybody out. I know a lot of people are angry. So just getting through these next few steps and not putting a label on anything. We’re just kind of taking a break for now.”</p><p>Raquel noted that she <a href=#>had plans to make amends</a> at the reunion, saying, “I know I have to take accountability for my actions so I’m completely prepared to do that.”</p><p>More recently, however, Ariana made it clear that<a href=#> the trio didn’t reach an understanding</a>. “No. I have nothing to say to either of them,” she told The New York Times earlier this month, when asked whether <a href=#>she was “open to filming with” her ex-boyfriend and Raquel</a> for season 11. “Our show is very real and follows a real group of friends, and neither of them are in the group of friends, so, good luck.”</p><p>The Something About Her cofounder said days later that Raquel <a href=#>appeared “lost” in the aftermath of the drama</a>.</p><p>“I mean, I don’t know her,” Ariana shared on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast on May 23. “I realize now I never knew her, but I certainly don’t know her now and I don’t know anyone who does know her. It’s hard to say, but based on what I’ve seen, [she’s] lost and empty. … I don’t really know what’s going on.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The third part of the Vanderpump Rules reunion airs on Wednesday, June 6, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>Scroll down for more revelations from the Vanderpump Rules reunion part two:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Brrq%2BwxKunrqWgYr%2B2uMSsZKydkai8r3mQaWSrnaWjtrC6jKmYq6xdZ3qjtcagnKysXaeyt7HLmquip56ofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
