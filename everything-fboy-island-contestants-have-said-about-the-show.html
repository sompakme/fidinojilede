Who will the women choose and find real love with?”</p><p>FBOY Island is hosted by comedian and actress Nikki Glaser, who appears to be recently <a href=#>switching lanes from comedy into reality TV</a>. With Season 2 of the show well underway, what have the contestants said about FBOY Island?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is The Star Of E!'s New Reality Show, Nikki Glaser?</a></span></p><h2 id=jarred-evans-was-grateful-to-be-on-the-show><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jarred Evans Was Grateful To Be On The Show</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Less than two years ago, Jarred Evans was playing professional football for the Wuhan Gators as a quarterback. Last year, he became one of the winners of FBOY Island Season 1, as was chosen by CJ Franco as her pick.</p><p>Writing on his Instagram page after the release of Season 1, Evans thanked his fans for their support along the journey: “I went from being a professional football player in Wuhan China to being one of the winners of the first season of a new @hbomax hit reality series @fboyisland.

Still, she felt that her time on the show had been a unique lesson which <a href=#>changed her perspective on dating</a>, and men in general.</p><p>“[<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">After FBOY Island</a>], I changed absolutely how I perceive men and dating,” she told Vulture in an interview.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>RHOBH Meets FBOY Island?

At the end, she chose Jared Motley, one of the self-professed FBoys on the show.</p><p>“[Being a contestant on FBOY Island] made me realize how important it is to take your time and get to know people when you’re dating them,” she said in the aftermath of the show. Her relationship with Motley was rather short, however, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they called it quits</a> in September 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jared-motley-called-fboy-island-an-ldquo-amazing-project-rdquo><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jared Motley Called FBOY Island An “Amazing Project”</span></h2><p>Another self-proclaimed FBoy, Jared Motley was one of the lucky winners from Season 1 of FBOY Island. He often goes by OG Jared, to differentiate himself from the other Jarred, who labeled himself a nice guy on entry to the show.</p><p>In an Instagram post promoting the series, Motley told his fans that FBOY Island was an “amazing project with hella excitement, that’s going to keep you on the edge of your seat.”</p><h2 id=sarah-emig-went-into-the-show-to-have-fun><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Sarah Emig Went Into The Show To Have Fun</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sarah Emig was the third woman on Season 1 of FBOY Island. FBoy Garrett Morowsky was the guy of her choice, but the BitCoin investor from LA decided to turn her down and keep the prize money instead. In a further twist, host Nikki Glaser told him that he couldn’t keep the money, and it had to go to a charity of Emig’s choice.</p><p>It was all brilliant fun, in line with the <a href=#>strategy that she had carried into the show</a>. “I was open to finding the possibility of finding love, but I was more so looking for fun and adventure,” Emig said in an exclusive interview with TheThings last September.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>FBOY Island EXCLUSIVE: Sarah Emig Opens Up About Picking The Wrong Guy</a></span></p><h2 id=peter-park-still-misses-the-show><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Peter Park Still Misses The Show</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Peter Park labeled himself an FBoy, and it cost him very early on in the show. He was eliminated by CJ Franco for a crass joke, a decision that even <a href=#>disappointed host Nikki Glaser</a>.</p><p>Park would later reveal that Glaser is one of the things he misses about FBOY Island. “I miss Limbro, because Limbro was fun. I miss the therapy sessions with Nikki Glaser, and the female anatomy class.” Limbro is a place where Glaser would send the FBoys to learn how to treat women.</p><h2 id=mercedes-knox-thinks-he-will-be-the-greatest-fboy-island-contestant-of-all-time><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Mercedes Knox Thinks He Will Be The Greatest FBOY Island Contestant Of All Time</span></h2><p>Mercedes Knox is one of the male contestants in the new season, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his goal has been pretty clear</a> from the very beginning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’m playing this game at the highest level it’s ever been played,” Knox told Bustle earlier this week, in true FBoy style. “No one has ever played his game the way that I have, and probably no one ever will.”</p><h2 id=mia-emani-jones-is-in-it-to-find-love><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Mia Emani Jones Is In It To Find Love</span></h2><p>As one of the women holding the cards in Season 2 of FBOY Island, Mia Emani Jones was not confused about what she is after on the show.</p><p>In an Instagram post referencing the new season, she wrote: “I’m looking for love… I can’t help it, I'm a hopeless romantic.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrOju9hmoKykkaOxbq%2FOp6ueq6SWu7W%2FjKGYr51dqK6qsIyamaitpGLBqbGMrJ%2Bor18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
