The Olympic skier first met Morgan in May 2012 — two weeks before he found out his ex-girlfriend Sara McKenna was pregnant with his child. Their son, Samuel, was born in February 2013, shortly before the exes were involved in a back-and-forth custody battle after the former Marine moved from California to New York without informing Bode."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Their son, Samuel, was born in February 2013, shortly before the exes were involved in <a href=#>a back-and-forth custody battle</a> after the former Marine moved from California to New York without informing Bode. (The case was eventually settled in 2014, with Bode receiving primary custody of Samuel.)</p><p class=p1>“Sometimes I think to myself, I’m <a href=#>probably the only woman in the world who would put up with this</a>,” Morgan told<a href=#> ESPN</a> in February 2014 of dealing with the custody dispute. “I told [Bode], ‘I know it’s scary and sad, but you’ve done this before. You’re going to step up to the plate, and you’re going to be fine.’”</p><p class=p1>Bode’s <a href=#>romance with the pro volleyball player quickly heated up</a>, as the pair <a href=#>tied the knot in October 2012</a> after five months of dating. One month after their nuptials, Morgan learned she was expecting the pair’s first child, however, she <a href=#>suffered a miscarriage</a> at 11 weeks.&nbsp;“I remember thinking the world is so damn unfair. It’s just cruel,” Morgan recalled to ESPN.</p><p class=p1>Bode — who also coparents daughter Neesyn, born in 2009, with ex <strong>Chanel Johnson</strong> — and Morgan have gone on<a href=#> to welcome a large brood</a> together. The married couple share Nash, born in 2015, Easton, born in 2018, <a href=#>twins Asher and Aksel</a>, born in 2019, and <a href=#>Scarlett</a>, born in 2021. Bode and Morgan welcomed daughter <a href=#>Emeline “Emmy”</a> in 2016, nearly <a href=#>two years before she tragically died</a> after drowning in a pool. She was 19 months.</p><p class=p1>“I can attest from firsthand experience now that it’s unbelievably quick and it’s unbelievably sneaky,” the winter Olympian recalled during <a href=#>a July 2018 interview on the&nbsp;<i>Today&nbsp;</i>show</a>. “You’d think it’d be, like, some weird circumstance or some strange thing. And, it’s not. It just happens in the blink of an eye.”</p><p class=p1>Morgan added at the time: “That was all I needed. And so, it’s one of those things where, as a parent now, when you go to someone else’s house, survey the home to see if it’s a safe place for your child to be.”</p><p class=p1>The twosome have since become <a href=#>fervent advocates for water safet</a>y as <a href=#>they continue to honor Emmy’s memory</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“This is what healing looks like. A broken heart slowly being put back together. Love, hope, faith, trust, incrementally being restored,” Morgan wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in February 2022. “So, no matter how broken you feel, remember, let love lead the way because LOVE ALWAYS WINS.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below for Bode and Morgan’s complete relationship timeline:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr7CwxGakoqScmr9urc2dZKanopyur3nBnpqkq12nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1uwMimnKWhnpp6sbTOraasZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
