She filed the case in November 2022, though the accusations only recently came to light. In legal documents, Wedaa claim that she and her fellow employees were subjected to hazardous and unhygienic working conditions, including 14-hour shifts without any breaks.</p><p>Moreover, upon being hired in 2019, Wedaa claims she was told to be discreet around the Bezos residence, meaning the family didn’t wat to see her around the property.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tr-dark.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jeff Bezos & Lauren Sanchez To Sign Huge Prenup To Protect His $149 Billion Fortune</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The Amazon CEO lost billions in his first divorce, so he likely doesn't want to make the same mistake.</span><p>One of the most disturbing allegation to rise from the case pertains to the limited access to restroom facilities for the housekeeping staff. During the times when the Bezos family was present in the home, the housekeepers were restricted from entering the residence except for cleaning duties.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As such, the staff weren’t allowed to use the residence’s washroom during those times. They were instructed to use a facility that was apparently hazardous to reach, including going through a window and through the mechanical room as well as laundry room.</p><p>As a result of not having access to a property bathroom facility, Wedaa claims she as well as other staff suffered from frequent UTI infections. She says employees had to endure these conditions for 18 months.</p><p>Wedaa’s other complaints include am lack of designated rest areas for the staff, and forcing housekeeping to eat their meals in the laundry room. Moreover, the plaintiff also describes instances of discriminatory treatment towards the Hispanic employees.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wedaa says she spoke up about the treatment of employees but says she was subsequently demoted and then fired.</p><p>For now, it’s unclear how much Wedaa is seeking in damages. But considering the severity of the claims, if her case is successful, it could mean a huge payout for Bezos. She’s also hoping to win back pay and benefits. The plaintiff claims she has ample evidence to back-up her claims.</p><p>The Amazon Inc. founder has replied to the lawsuit via his representative and is denying the allegations. Moreover, his attorney claims that Wedaa only filed her lawsuit after her request for a $9 million settlement was rejected by Bezos’ legal team.</p><p>While it’s unclear if Bezos will come out on the winning side of this lawsuit, what is clear is that he has the means to pay the legal bills, considering his <a href=#>net worth is nearly $150 billion</a>, making him one of the world’s richest people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmo52Wm3qjsdmoqmadqGK1sMHSnqKenaCav26%2F1J6qZpyRoq6osdJmoKegpaKur7GMsKaro12YvK%2BwyK2gqKajZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
