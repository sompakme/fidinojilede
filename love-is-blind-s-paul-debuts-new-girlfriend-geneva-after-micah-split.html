“Maybe best cocktails in San Diego,” Paul, 29, wrote via his Instagram Story on Thursday, June 1, alongside a sweet selfie of him and new girlfriend Geneva Dunham at the Noble Experiment speakeasy during a California vacation.
Dunham, for her part, also took to social media to share photos and videos from a separate Georgia getaway, which included photographs of them relaxing by the pool, taking in a baseball game and sharing a sweet smooch on the sidewalk."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Thank you @hollychelsea and @jobrian24 for the southern hospitality.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">This marks Paul’s first public relationship since he split from Micah, 27, aired earlier this year. The environmental scientist and marketing campaign manager <a href=#>got engaged on season 4</a> of the Netflix dating series, which premiered in March. The pair faced a handful of challenges on their way to the alter — including Micah’s lingering feelings for fellow contestant<a href=#><strong> Kwame Appiah</strong></a> — and ultimately didn’t tie the knot.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">When the moment came to say “I do,” Micah insisted that Paul be the first to answer on their wedding day. “It was kind of the last chance [for Paul] to, like, show me that <a href=#>you’re willing to take the risk and take the jump</a>,” she exclusively told Us Weekly&nbsp;in April of the tense finale moment. “And I think that having him answer first was really the only way to do that. I worried that, maybe, he would say yes if I said yes — and I really wanted him to answer from his heart.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">While she shared that she “never doubted” that her ex-fiancé “cared” about her, Micah pointed out that “there’s no way of telling” whether they’d still be together if they had gotten married.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Love-Is-Blind-s-Paul-Peden-Seemingly-Debuts-New-Girlfriend-Geneva-Dunham-After-Split-From-Ex-Fiance-Micah-Lussier-215.jpg><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Paul, for his part, told Us that he was “super torn” up about his choice “until the very moment” he was standing in front of his bride.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“And I hadn’t made the decision, you know, as soon as it came out of my mouth, that’s<a href=#> when the decision was made</a>,” he explained. “I don’t regret it. It was the right call, I think, at the time, and it was a realization that while we did love who we were in that moment, there’s a lot more to marrying someone than just that.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The twosome briefly gave their relationship another try after cameras stopped rolling, but they ultimately decided to call it quits for good prior to the season 4 reunion in April.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">During the reunion special, the Louisiana native came under fire when host <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Lachey</strong></a> questioned his on-camera remarks about how he didn’t see his then-fiancée as the mother of his children.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Paul told<a href=#> Entertainment Tonight</a> later that month that he felt like there was a “personal bias” against him at the taping, claiming was “extremely reductive” of Lachey, 42, to dismiss “all nuance and complexity” as to why he said “no” at the altar.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“I was like, ‘F—k man.’ They kept drilling, drilling it down on me,” he told the outlet. “I think I said my piece. I think Vanessa might have had a little bit of personal bias in that scenario or at least I kind of detected that. I don’t know. But that’s just my assumption based on how she continued to drill into it after I gave my full rationale for why I felt the way that I did.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The Disaster Movie star — who shares kids Camden, 10, Brooklyn, 8, and Phoenix, 6, with husband and Love Is Blind cohost <a href=#><strong>Nick Lachey</strong></a> — subsequently sent Paul flowers <a href=#>to apologize for their heated exchange</a>. “Thanks for acknowledging the accidental misleading @vanessalachey,” Paul wrote via his Instagram Stories in April alongside a snap of the bouquet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOorpVitrR5waWgp5yjYr2iwctmm56apanAbrrEsGSgoaKhs7O1xKebZp%2BVo7K3rYyana2domK6qq%2FAoWSsqJyewXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
