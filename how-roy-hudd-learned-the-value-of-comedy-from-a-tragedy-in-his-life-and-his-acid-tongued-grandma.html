The veteran TV and radio actor and comic, who died on Sunday aged 83, was evacuated as a child in World War Two to Northampton from the family home in South London with his brother Peter.
When the boys returned, their parents had vanished and the Hudd boys were told they were moving in with their gran, Alice."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He said: “I think I was most upset about Father Christmas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000571236215-e1584397735865.jpg><p>“My mother had not been part of my life for so long.</p><p>“My gran could turn every situation into a gag. You’d be very upset about things and she’d do a funny line at the end of it. It really put things into perspective.”</p><p>Alice always described Roy as “a fart in a colander” — which decades later became the title of his autobiography.<br></p><h2>PECULIAR PERSON</h2><p>While researching it, Roy discovered his father had walked out and started a second family, while his mother had indeed killed herself, by diverting a gas pipe into her bedroom.</p><p>Although money was tight, Alice insisted on taking her grandsons to Croydon Empire every Tuesday night to see the biggest comedy stars of the day — Max Miller, Bud Flanagan, Hetty King and Sid Field.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000571230997-1.jpg><p>To stay out of trouble at school, teachers encouraged Roy to join a youth drama group, where he was asked: “Are you as funny as you look?” Mimicking his comic heroes proved he was.</p><p>After a string of jobs, Roy finally became a comic. In 1957 he appeared on stage at the Streatham Hill Theatre as The Peculiar Person, and even performed with his hero, Max Miller. An unknown Benny Hill was the compere.</p><p>He went on to have a career spanning 63 years, and in 1975 landed his own Radio 2 show, The News Huddlines — one of the longest-running radio comedy shows.</p><p>But he quit in 2001 after 26 years when bosses told him to, “be more like Jonathan Ross”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000571344403.jpg><p>The following year he landed the part of undertaker Archie Shuttleworth in Coronation Street. He joked: “Every time I reappeared on it the rest of the cast would get worried.</p><p>“They knew that one of them would not have their contract renewed!”</p><p>Showing his range, he appeared in Broadchurch in 2017 playing the father of Olivia Colman’s character.</p><p>When she won an Academy Award for Best Actress in The Favourite, he told everyone: “My daughter’s got an Oscar.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000000925502-1-e1584397786280.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">One of the real greats</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000571231381-2.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>SHOWBIZ paid its respects to Roy on Monday night, here are just some of the tributes.</p><p><strong>Sandi Toksvig: </strong>“Roy Hudd was a comic genius but more than that he was one of the nicest people in showbusiness. The heavens will be rocking with laughter.”</p><p><strong>Danny Baker:</strong> “Bravo, Roy Hudd. I hope you can hear the applause thundering in your ears. What a turn. What an archive. What company. Now you can give Max Miller his hat back.”</p><p><strong>Rory Bremner: </strong>“The lovely Roy Hudd embodied a whole strand of the DNA of British comedy, from music hall and variety to pantomime and stand-up. A living museum, full of joy, humour and enthusiasm. A great life and a great loss.</p><p><strong>Ted Robbins:</strong> “One of the true greats of the business has taken his final curtain call. He was a hugely talented link to the past of music hall and variety and a lovely, lovely man.</p><p><strong>Gyles Brandreth: </strong>“So sad. He was such fun, so funny and so talented. Here’s hoping there’s a heaven where he can be reunited with old friends like June Whitfield and meet all his heroes.”</p><p><strong>Samuel West: </strong>“Roy Hudd has left the stage, and all of us are poorer for it. An endlessly entertaining comic, a fabulous actor and one of the absolutely nicest people.”</p><p><strong>Mark Gatiss,</strong> who worked with Roy on the remake of Randall And Hopkirk (Deceased), said he was: “One of those joyous people who feel like they’ve been with us for ever.”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000571231381-2.jpg><p>Roy married dance teacher Ann Lambert in 1963 and they named their son Max, now 50, after music hall star Max Miller.</p><p>Roy claimed he only realised the marriage was over after 20 years when he read a newspaper headline: “Hudd’s wife sues for divorce”. Four years later, at the age of 51, he married Debbie Flitcroft, a young dancer he met while playing in Babes In The Wood. They married in 1988 after he proposed at Watford Gap motorway services.</p><p>In the early 60s his agent warned Roy that the musical hall was dying and he should become an actor — and a whole new career opened up.</p><p>As well as appearing in TV shows such as Midsomer Murders, Holby City, Casualty and Call The Midwife, Roy was a music hall ex- pert, re-recording old songs and hosting The Good Old Days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000571230845-1-e1584397468223.jpg><p>When he appeared on Celebrity Mastermind in 2014 he chose the music hall as his specialist subject.</p><p>In later years his weight ballooned to 20st and he suffered from diabetes. Doctors said his life was in danger unless he slimmed. So last January he had a gastric sleeve op to curb his appetite and he lost 8st.</p><p>On Monday night his long-time friend, comedian Barry Cryer, said <a href=#>Britain had lost a true legend</a>. He said: “I saw Roy last year at a reunion for people who used to work in Danny La Rue’s nightclub. He was looking frail. We were pretty shocked.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in tv and showbiz</h2></p><p>“But he still managed to make everyone laugh — you just couldn’t stop him. He gave a little speech and brought the house down.”</p><p>Barry added: “Everyone loved him.</p><p>“You never heard a bad word about him, which is rare in showbusiness.”</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Classic Coronation Street: Roy Hudd as Archie the undertaker has a glass of water thrown in his&nbsp; face by an angry Blanche</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhpYWaFeICWamarp6litbaww2abnpmUYoV0ecKopJ6cqWLBs63GnpuyZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
