See ya tonight Vegas ❤️ #iHeartFestival2023.”</p><p>In the video, Clarkson belts out <a href=#><strong>Tina Turner</strong></a>’s “What’s Love Got to Do With It,” while donning a head to toe black outfit and a black baseball cap. The street performer dances and claps along on the side while watching Clarkson sing.</p><p>Moments later, the woman seemingly realized the powerful voice who was behind the microphone. She screamed and threw her hands up, enveloping Clarkson in a big hug.</p><p>“I was like, ‘You sound so good!’” Clarkson said to the woman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kelly-Clarkson-Surprises-Street-Musician-in-Vegas-Joins-Her-in-Singing-on-Street-Inline.jpg><p>“Are you f–king kidding me!” the woman yelled.</p><p>While the two embraced, the crowd cheered in the background, with onlookers filming the impromptu performance.</p><p>Clarkson ended her Vegas residency last month. The American Idol winner performed songs off her latest album, <a href=#>Chemistry</a>, which she released a deluxe version of on Friday, September 22.</p><p>She brought out two familiar faces while on stage in August. Her daughter <a href=#>River Rose</a>, 9, and son Remington, 7, joined her for separate songs during a concert on August 18.</p><p>“Both of my kiddos backstage getting ready to join me on stage in Vegas ❤️ nothing will ever be as cool and amazing as these two little humans that will always have my whole heart,” she <a href=# rel=noopener>captioned an Instagram post</a> at the time.</p><p>Clarkson shares both of her children with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Brandon Blackstock</strong></a>, whom she was married to for seven years. She <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from Blackstock, 43, in 2020, citing “irreconcilable differences.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The <a href=#>divorce was settled</a> in 2022, following a <a href=#>long and messy legal battle</a> ending with Clarkson paying a lump sum of $1.3 million and paying Blackstock $45,601 a month in child support and $115,000 per month in spousal support until January 2024.</p><p>Blackstock and Clarkson’s daughter also is <a href=#>featured on the track</a> “You Don’t Make Me Cry,” where she sings background vocals. When the song comes to a close, River Rose says, “The end.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKepJyueqS4wKuirKeeYsC2vs%2BroKydo2LAtb7EnqtmpaWotqS1wKdkoqZdq7KordJmqqKml6h6sLqMrKurnZWpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
