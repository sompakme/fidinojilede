On the other hand, during Woody Allen's lengthy career, the famous actor, writer, and director was known for playing characters he had a lot in common with.As a result of the kind of movies he made, there has been a lot of interest in Allen's personal life since the beginning of his career. A perfect example of that is many people have long been interested in <a href=#>Allen's relationship with his costar Diane Keaton</a>.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Alec Baldwin And Woody Allen's Relationship</a></span>After Allen married Soon-Yi Previn, people were fascinated by their scandalous relationship even though they tried to <a href=#>keep their marriage and kids out of the spotlight</a>. More recently, allegations that Allen abused people have gotten enough attention that many stars have professed that <a href=#>they regret working with him</a>.Before Allen began working with Keaton, married Previn, or was disavowed by many of his past collaborators, he married a woman named Harlene Rosen. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, what has happened to Rosen?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-has-woody-allen-been-dated>Who Has Woody Allen Been Dated?</h2><p>Before Woody Allen became a huge star, he walked down the aisle for the first time when he was a young man. During the 50s, a then 20-year-old Allen married a woman named Harlene Rosen who was 17. As it turned out, the couple divorced after only a handful of years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Javier Bardem Says Accusations Against Woody Allen Are "Just Gossip"</a></span></p><p>After Allen's first marriage ended, he went on to tie the knot with an actor named Louise Lasser. Unfortunately for the couple, their marriage also proved to be short-lived as they reportedly went their separate ways roughly four years after their wedding.</p><p>After Allen's first two marriages, he went on to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">linked to several stars</a>. Most notably, Allen has been linked to Diane Keaton, Charlotte Rampling, and Mia Farrow at one time or another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, Allen's relationship with Farrow which lasted for more than a decade has resulted in a lot of controversies. Initially, that controversy revolved around the fact that Allen broke up with Farrow and went on to date her adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn.</p><p>After Allen and Previn's relationship began in 1992, they walked down the aisle in 1997. Even though Previn is more than three decades younger than Allen, the couple has remained together ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of Allen leaving Farrow for her adopted daughter, the former couple's relationship is now controversial for another reason. After all, Farrow's daughter Dylan has publicly accused Allen of abuse.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-woody-allen-s-first-wife>What Happened To Woody Allen's First Wife?</h2><p>Throughout Woody Allen and Harlene Rosen's marriage, she never seemed to seek out the spotlight. However, Allen sometimes brought attention to his wife at the time in a way that would hurt a lot of people's feelings.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Woody Allen's Memoir Released Despite Being Dumped Amid Controversy</a></span></p><p>Since Allen is famous for his work in Hollywood, some people have forgotten that in the past he performed as a comedian regularly. Just like his movies, Allen's standup bits often focused on real things from his personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given Allen's style of comedy, it isn't surprising that he joked about his first wife while performing onstage. Unfortunately for Rosen, however, Allen was known to refer to his first wife as Quasimodo during his stage act and even mocked her during TV appearances.</p><p>According to Allen's later comments about his ex-wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rosen once sued him for defamation</a> for the way he spoke about her in public.</p><p>Given the way that Allen portrayed her during their marriage, it makes perfect sense that Rosen avoided the spotlight following their divorce. In fact, aside from unattributed reports that Rosen still lives in America, nothing is known about her life since her split from Allen.</p><p>Even though Rosen has led an anonymous life since her 1962 divorce from Allen, observers learned something about where she is emotionally in recent years. The reason for that is Rosen shocked many when she suddenly shone a spotlight on her relationship with Allen in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In November 2015, Allen celebrated a major moment in his life when he turned 80 years old. To the surprise of virtually everyone, his first wife opted to celebrate that milestone in her own way by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">releasing a heartfelt message about her famous ex-husband</a>.</p><p>"Wondrous Woody, you inspired me with your enormous energy, creativity, and charisma. I loved going to the movies with you. I loved making music with you…"</p><p>"After our teenage summer of love, marriage was difficult. You established a career. I completed four years of college. We supported each other, learned about life, and became adults. There was sadness, tears, laughter, and love."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bsPOqJuyZZGhuaa6jLCgn51dna6zuMSnnGaqn6iyr3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
