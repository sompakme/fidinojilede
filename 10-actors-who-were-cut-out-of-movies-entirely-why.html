From actors like Robert Pattinson and Tobey Maguire and actresses like Angela Bassett and Shailene Woodley, these stars have been cut out of movies without any rhyme or reason.</p><h2 id=robert-pattinson---vanity-fair><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Robert Pattinson - 'Vanity Fair'</span></h2><p><a href=#>Robert Pattinson</a> might be a big-name actor these days, but he also had to get his career started somewhere. He managed to get the role of Reese Witherspoon's son in the movie&nbsp;Vanity Fair. It wasn't until he went to the screening of the film that he was informed that he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cut from the film completely</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Bravo Reality TV Stars Who Got Fired By The Network & Why</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The casting director felt bad about the whole thing, therefore she helped him get the role of Cedric Diggory in&nbsp;Harry Potter. As disappointed as he was about being cut from the movie, it definitely opened another door for him, so it all worked out in the long run anyway. It's safe to say that Robert was pretty content with being cut from the film.</p><h2 id=angela-bassett---mr-amp-mrs-smith><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Angela Bassett - 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith'</span></h2><p>Many people not might realize that Angela Bassett was once cast in the movie&nbsp;Mr. & Mrs. Smith. You might not realize that she was in the movie because she was actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cut out at the last minute</a>. Angela Bassett played a villain alongside Keith David. The two came in at the end of the movie, however, producers decided to cut them out completely because he didn't think that the ending of the movie needed a final battle with the villains. Unfortunately, only Angela's voice was used.</p><h2 id=tobey-maguire---life-of-pi><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Tobey Maguire - 'Life Of Pi'</span></h2><p><a href=#>Tobey Maguire</a> is most known for playing Spider-Man, so it seems kind of odd that he would ever be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cut from a film</a>. Tobey had a role in the movie&nbsp;Life of Pi&nbsp;but was suddenly cut from the movie. Instead, they decided that they were going to recast his part and gave it to actor Rafe Spall.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Directors Who Went And Got Themselves Fired</a></span></p><p>At first, it wasn't publicized why Tobey was taken out of the film, but it turned out that producers thought that Tobey was too famous for the role, and they were worried that he would be a distraction for viewers. By replacing him with Rafe Spall who is still a very good actor but less well known, would definitely solve the problem that producers were afraid of.</p><h2 id=ellen-pompeo---eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ellen Pompeo - 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind'</span></h2><p><a href=#>Ellen Pompeo</a> was supposed to be in&nbsp;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, however, she was ultimately <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cut from the film</a>. Originally, Ellen played the role of Naomi, who is the ex-girlfriend of Joel who is played by Jim Carrey. Unfortunately, producers decided that they were going to take out all of the scenes that included Ellen in it. They decided that they didn't like how her character changed the way that viewers would see Jim Carrey's character. As a result, she was the one to go out of the two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sienna-miller---black-mass><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sienna Miller - 'Black Mass'</span></h2><p>When <a href=#>Sienna Miller</a> was cast in&nbsp;Black Mass, people were intrigued by how she would&nbsp;impact the film. Sienna played the role of Catherine Greig, who was the girlfriend of the gangster Whitey Bulger played by Johnny Depp. Unfortunately for both Sienna and her fans, she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cut from the film</a>. Even though producers loved her performance in the movie, they decided that they were going to cut her from the film in order to make the narrative of the movie go in a different direction.</p><h2 id=la-toya-jackson---bruno><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>La Toya Jackson - 'Bruno'</span></h2><p>La Toya Jackson was set to appear in a scene in the movie&nbsp;Bruno, however, she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cut from the movie</a>. The edit to the movie was cut very last minute as the movie premiered not long after the tragic death of her brother Michael Jackson. With respect for La Toya and the Jackson family, they decided that they were going to cut the scene out of the film as they believed it would be in poor taste after she suffered such a tragic loss.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shailene-woodley---the-amazing-spider-man-2><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Shailene Woodley - 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2'</span></h2><p>Many people didn't realize that <a href=#>Shailene Woodley</a> was actually in&nbsp;The Amazing Spider-Man 2 where she played Mary Jane Watson. Although she's the future love interest of Peter Parker, she was completely <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cut from the movie</a>.&nbsp;Even though she filmed a number of scenes, they decided to scrap them in order to focus on the relationship between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy a little more, and that they'd focus more on Mary Jane later on. Luckily, Shailene just needs to wait a little longer to take on the role.</p><h2 id=paul-rudd---bridesmaids><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Paul Rudd - 'Bridesmaids'</span></h2><p>Believe it or not, <a href=#>Paul Rudd</a> was in the hilarious movie&nbsp;Bridesmaids. Paul played Annie's blind date gone wrong. As funny as the scene turned out to be, producers decided that they were going to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cut it from the movie entirely</a>. Unfortunately for Paul Rudd, the movie was running over two and a half hours and they needed to make multiple cuts to the movie to make it shorter. As a result, they decided that Annie didn't need another man to further complicate things in her life, and they cut him out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashley-judd---natural-born-killers><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ashley Judd - 'Natural Born Killers'</span></h2><p>When it comes to the movie&nbsp;Natural Born Killers, <a href=#>Ashley Judd</a> was sadly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cut from the film</a>. Ashley didn't have a very important or huge role in the movie, therefore producers didn't have a problem cutting her out. She played a sorority girl that survived a massacre in her sorority house, and she was the only one who made it out alive. In the scene, she was in the courthouse where she was being questioned. Unfortunately, she didn't live long as she was stabbed to death.</p><h2 id=kevin-spacey---all-the-money-in-the-world><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kevin Spacey - 'All The Money In The World'</span></h2><p>Originally, <a href=#>Kevin Spacey</a> played the role of J. Paul Getty in the movie&nbsp;All the Money in the World. However, after a number of accusations of sexual assault against him, producers decided to take action and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">remove him from the film</a>. As a result, they decided to completely recast him with Christopher Plummer. The film was just about to be released, so they had to act fast. They decided to reshoot as many scenes as they possibly could, and combined old footage with new footage to make sure that Kevin Spacey was completely removed from the movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Reality TV Stars Who Got Themselves Fired</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnKyfp8Buw8eoZLCdopp6pMHTZqaurF2ks265zq%2Bgnqtdmru1tdGeo7Jlp53GcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
