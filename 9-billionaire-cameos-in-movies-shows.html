In 2021, it seems as though a quick <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cameo</a> in a feature film is an extra status symbol for the likes of those celebrities that don’t claim to have acting chops.</p><p>However, a famous face can often add authenticity to a scene or situation, regardless of skill, because they are already known in that profession. It’s not uncommon for iconic movie stars to make an appearance, but rarer still, is the quick glimpse of the world’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">billionaires</a> – a status held by only a few thousand people globally.</p><p>Here’s a list of those <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">famous faces</a> you may or may not recognize but carry a sizeable wallet just the same.</p><h2 id=warren-buffett-108-7-billion>Warren Buffett – $108.7 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps one of the most famous billionaires on the planet has had his fun making cameo appearances in everything from soap opera, “All My Children” to the NBC sitcom, “The Office”. His leap to the big screen, gave him a scene in film “Entourage” in 2015. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>, Buffett has a brief scene midway through the film. He has the chance to throw out a few fun statements before he takes off on his golfcart at the Warner Brothers studio backlot.</p><h2 id=sergey-brin-100-5-billion>Sergey Brin – $100.5 Billion</h2><p>The Google co-founder hasn’t made a ton of appearances, but it only makes sense for him to appear toward the end of 2013’s “The Internship” a film about two older men, played by Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson landing an internship at the famous company. Brin also appeared as himself in 2010’s “Man on a Mission” about computer game developer Richard Garriott’s spaceflight in 2008.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elon-musk-155-1-billion>Elon Musk – $155.1 Billion</h2><p>Tesla’s CEO likes to dabble in a variety of businesses and Hollywood is just another area to conquer. Musk has had small parts in “Iron Man 2” and “Machete Kills”. In 2010, Musk’s role in “Iron Man 2” is as himself and according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Housekeeping</a>, he’s seen chatting with Robert Downey Jr.’s character Tony Stark about engines and electric jets.</p><h2 id=michael-bloomberg-59-billion>Michael Bloomberg – $59 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The former mayor of New York City appeared in the 2011 film, “The Adjustment Bureau” with Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. Damon plays a politician, running for the New York State Senate and fittingly, Bloomberg lends his well-known face to play the current mayor of New York. <a href=#>Bloomberg</a> has been seen numerous times in television cameo’s but “The Adjustment Bureau” was his first big-screen appearance.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Vanderpump's Dogs Foundation Raises Over $200,000 Via Cameo</a></span></p><h2 id=jeff-bezos-189-2-billion>Jeff Bezos – $189.2 Billion</h2><p>For a self-described ultimate Star Trek fan, it may not have been so much the notoriety but the sheer pleasure of working with the cast of “Star Trek and Beyond” in 2016. You may not have recognized him in the large amounts of makeup and prosthetics directors had on the Amazon CEO but he was fulfilling a life-long dream, so it probably doesn’t matter.</p><h2 id=richard-branson-5-1-billion>Richard Branson – $5.1 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CheatSheet</a>, the Virgin Group icon has appeared in several television episodes from “Friends” to “The Simpsons” but his brief cameo on the big screen belongs to the 2006 James Bond flick, “Casino Royale”. Oddly enough, Branson was edited out of the British Airways version due to their competition with Virgin Group.</p><h2 id=larry-ellison-103-1-billion>Larry Ellison – $103.1 Billion</h2><p>Who is Larry Ellison you might ask? The eighth wealthiest man on the plant and co-founder of Oracle Corporation, the software company second only to Microsoft. Ellison was another cameo welcomed in “Iron Man 2”. He has no lines and is just a brief face passing by Downey Jr.’s character but for those with a quick eye and knowledge of the high-powered billionaire network, you’ll see him in the first five minutes of the film.</p><h2 id=ted-turner-2-2-billion>Ted Turner – $2.2 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Turner actually created his own role for the 1993 film “Gettysburg”. The film was originally a miniseries for TNT and then released in movie theaters by New Line Cinema. Turner owned both, making his role as a Confederate soldier who quickly meets his demise, sort of anticlimactic. In 2001, he reprised his role in yet another film he financed, “Gods and Generals”. Like Bezos, sometimes you have the funds to check something special off your bucket list.</p><h2 id=mark-cuban-4-4-billion>Mark Cuban – $4.4 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=#>Dallas Mavericks owner</a> has made a name for himself of the hit television show, “Shark Tank”. He’s been seen in television shows like “Grace and Frankie”, “The Rookie” and “Entourage” but when it comes to the theaters, Cuban can be seen in 2019’s “What Men Want” and 2015’s movie version of the popular series, “Entourage”. His quick cameo is shared with another popular actor, Bob Odenkirk of “Better Call Saul”.</p><p>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">6 Actors Who Crossed $100 Million Multiple Times At The Box Office</a></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Housekeeping</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CheatSheet</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSvqrjLoqanmZmnsm6vwKacqKtdory3tcSsZKygn6zAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
