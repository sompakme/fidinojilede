Now, it appears she finally agreed amid their ongoing divorce and financial issues, as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Milton, Georgia mansion has been listed for $6 million</a>.</p><p>The residence comes with 7 bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, an arcade, a bar, a wine cellar, a movie theater, and a gym. Even more, the outdoor area boasts a pool and a basketball court and is also adjacent to a country club. Should Kroy, 38, and Kim, 45, receive the full asking price (or higher) for the property, it’ll be an incredible profit, considering they only paid $880,000 for the mansion in 2012.</p><p>Interestingly, a report by <a href=#>Zillow </a><a href=#>said the home was initially listed for $3 million</a> on October 3, but the asking price was swiftly changed to $6 million on October 16.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Kroy-Biermann-Claims-Kim-Zolciak’s-Gambling-Problem-Led-To-Financial-Trouble-.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kroy Biermann Claims Kim Zolciak’s Gambling Caused Financial Troubles</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The estranged couple filed for divorce last month after 12 years of marriage.</span><p>In September, <a href=#>Kroy issued a public plea to Kim</a> to agree to sell the property in order to help resolve their ongoing financial issues, which <a href=#>includes over $1 million in IRS debt</a>, and reportedly contributed to their split.</p><p>Kroy, who initiated divorce proceedings against Kim in May and then again in August following a brief reconciliation, sought an expedited hearing that month to accelerate the sale of their home.</p><p>His court submission disclosed that the residence had initially been scheduled for auction in March due to foreclosure proceedings initiated the prior month. Fortunately, the exes (who share six children) were able to stave off foreclosure and subsequently canceled the auction thanks to an agreement with the financial institution Truist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kim-zolciak-calls-police-as-ex-won-t-let-her-have-20-000-mattress-amid-divorce.jpg> Kim Zolciak and Kroy Biermann <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As per the agreement, so long as the couple consistently made their mortgage payments for three consecutive months, any outstanding balances would be deferred to the end of the loan, preventing the foreclosure.</p><p>Kroy and Kim may be selling their home, but their divorce remains ongoing. The former NFL player has <a href=#>accused Kim of planning to file for bankruptcy</a> in an effort to keep them legally married, though this remains unconfirmed.</p><p>More recently, authorities showed up to their Atlanta mansion to respond to a call made by Kim. She claimed Kroy had locked her out of their master bedroom, and <a href=#>she needed access to a $20,000 mattress</a>, as she was recovering from surgery. No arrests were made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpKGdYsewuMKimKRlkZy%2FprHSZqqepJxig265yKWjoqeeYrqiutKipqdlkZvBpr6MpKmosV2Xtqa%2BzJqlp2Wgqq%2BttcJmp6WdkWKxqsLOq5qeZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
