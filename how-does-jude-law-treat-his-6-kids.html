Yes, its actor <strong>Jude Law</strong>, who through his series of past relationships has fathered no less than six children. To give a brief overview, Jude Law's first three children <strong>Rafferty</strong> (25); <strong>Iris</strong> (21), and <strong>Rudy</strong> (19) are all by his first wife <strong>Sadie Frost</strong>, to whom Law was married between 1997 and 2003.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon after this marriage ended, Law began a relationship with actress <strong>Sienna Miller</strong>. Though they were engaged, the couple ended their relationship following Jude's public admission of an affair with his children's nanny.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Inside Kate Moss' Scandalous Relationship With Ex-Couple, Jude Law And Sadie Frost</a></span></p><p>His fourth child, Sophia, 12, came from his brief relationship with model <strong>Samantha Burke</strong>. And in 2015, Jude was blessed with another daughter, Ada, with singer <strong>Catherine Harding</strong>. In September last year Law and his wife Phillipa Coan welcomed their first child together - whose name is not yet known. So how does the father juggle his parental duties towards all his kids, and how does he shape up as a dad? Well, let's find out.</p><h2 id=rafferty><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Rafferty</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Law's eldest child, son Rafferty Jellicoe Frost, 25, was born shortly before his parents marriage in 1997. Rafferty has followed his dad's career path into acting, and certainly bears a striking resemblance to his famous dad! He has many other talents however, and has branched out into modelling, DJing, and music - having recently released his first EP.</p><p>Rafferty seems to share a close relationship with his dad. During lockdown, the pair have been working on a short film, The Hat, which was filmed on an iPhone!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jude Law, Johnny Depp And Colin Farrell Gave Up Their Salary For This Celeb's Daughter</a></span></p><h2 id=iris><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Iris</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Iris, 21, who has forged a very successful career as a model and is an ambassador for Dior, is blessed with Kate Moss for a godmother and has inherited her father's good looks. This girl really hit the jackpot. She credits her upbringing for helping her have the confidence to make daring artistic choices, and has described her relationship with dad Jude as incredibly supportive. In an interview with the Evening Standard, Iris said:</p><p>‘I tape [auditions] with my dad. He gives me great tips. But more generally I’ve been brought up with morals, not necessarily to do with acting but for life. I’ve always been told to be polite, to be on time, to be attentive, to work really hard.’</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who is Jude Law's Daughter, Iris?</a></span></p><h2 id=rudy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Rudy</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rudy Law, 19, has also been lucky enough to inherit his dad's genes, and like his older siblings has also gone into modelling, being signed to IMG Models. He also shares a great relationship with their dad, and its clear that Jude makes time for all of his children and cherishes celebrating milestones and achievements together. For Rudy's 18th birthday celebrations last year, he was papped partying with his dad on the streets of London, and appeared to share a great father-son bond.</p><h2 id=sophia><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sophia</span></h2><p>Sophia, 12, is the only child Jude shares with Samantha Burke, an American model with whom he had only a brief relationship. As Sophia lives with her mother in Florida, she doesn't see so much of her dad. Their relationship is not close, and it has been reported that he only sees his daughter once a year. However, Jude financially supports his daughter very generously, apparently paying $6,000 a month in child support costs, as well as schooling and medical fees. This will continue until Sophia turns 18.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ada><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ada</span></h2><p>Ada, Jude's fifth child, is six years old, and was born following a brief relationship with singer Catherine Harding. Though they had broken up before Ada's birth, both Catherine and Jude remained committed to their daughter, and resolved to provide her a good relationship with her father.</p><p>Speaking about Jude to The Mirror, Catherine said "He [Jude] is a good dad and she sees her brothers and sisters. He takes her out all the time. [Ada] looks like Jude massively, she doesn't look like me".</p><h2 id=new-baby><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>New Baby</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jude married girlfriend Phillipa Coan back in 2019, holding a small ceremony in London. Its clear the actor is looking to put his wild days behind him, and is committed to really settling down this time with his new wife, valuing the privacy of their relationship, having said "I'm very, very happy. Our relationship is a very private thing, and I think part of the fact it works so well is exactly because of that."</p><p>Jude announced the birth of their first child together in September last year, but neither the name or gender of the baby have yet to be released.</p><p>"It's really wonderful," he shared. "We feel pretty blessed that we were in a time where we could, as a family, just nest and enjoy each other's company and every day as it came."</p><p>Jude seems to be a hands-on dad, as he's been papped regularly pushing the pram on the streets of London.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Kind Of Relationship Does Sienna Miller Have With Jude Law Now?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbymv4yjrJ2dXaGuuHnTq5yarF2dtrR5lWaiopyjYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMrJidoZVis7O70q1krKGVo7uiecyio6WdomLAornAp6uhmV2XwrO3xGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
