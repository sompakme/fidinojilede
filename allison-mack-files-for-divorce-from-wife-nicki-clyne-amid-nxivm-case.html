She was indicted on multiple counts of sex-trafficking, sex-trafficking conspiracy and conspiracy to commit forced labor after allegedly recruiting women to be slaves for <a href=#><strong>Keith Raniere</strong></a>, the leader of a sex-trafficking cult within New York-based marketing firm NXIVM known as DOS. She was also accused of identity fraud and money laundering.</p><p>Mack pleaded guilty to racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges in April 2019. She had previously pleaded not guilty to the counts.</p><p>“As alleged in the indictment, <a href=#>Allison Mack recruited women to join</a> what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere,” United States Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter at the time. “The <a href=#>victims were then exploited</a>, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit.”</p><p>Mack has yet to be sentenced in the case.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The American Odyssey alum <a href=#>recruited women into the cult</a> by describing it as “a women’s empowerment group or sorority,” according to court documents obtained by Us in April 2018. She allegedly made victims provide “naked photographs, assets, criminal confessions and other damaging information, known as collateral.”</p><p>Mack performed “ceremonies in which her slaves were branded,” the documents claimed. “[She] would place her hands on the slaves’ chests and told them to ‘feel the pain’ and to ‘think of their master,’ as slaves cried in pain.”</p><p>Raniere, the cofounder of the cult, was sentenced to 120 years in prison in October. He was convicted of seven felonies related to NXIVM, although he maintained that he was “innocent” in an interview with NBC News ahead of his sentencing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapJyewLC6jKaYnKNdm7atsdJmnaiqXZm2t7vRnJxmnqKkum7DyJ%2BcZqaZmLiqecKlsKedXZa6qrCMp6%2Birp1isKK%2FxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
