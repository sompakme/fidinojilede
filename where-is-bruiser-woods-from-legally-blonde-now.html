But although IG pups are a modern trend, fans have always been all about the furry celebrities in Hollywood.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus Just Introduced Her New Dog To Instagram!</a></span></p><p>For example, Bruiser Woods stole the show in a few 'Legally Blonde' scenes, and his outfits that matched Reese's amazing wardrobe were absolutely adorable. He was also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">just as spoiled as Paris Hilton's dogs</a>, or possibly more so.</p><p>So of course fans want to know, whatever happened to Bruiser Woods post-'Legally Blonde'?</p><p>Well first, Bruiser -- whose real name is Moondoggie AKA Moonie -- was also in 'Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde,' but his time in Hollywood didn't end there. Moonie's other jobs included a music video with Cher and a handful of commercials, plus some TV work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sydney Morning Herald</a> explained long ago, Moonie's destiny was kind of made by 'Legally Blonde.' His trainer wanted him to stand in as a double for the Taco Bell chihuahua, one of her other pups, Gidget (who played Bruiser's mama in 'Legally Blonde 2'!), but he never got big enough.</p><p>Moonie did reappear when Reese received her 'Walk of Fame' star, but after that, fans were left to wonder what happened to him. As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolfstoria</a> explained, Moonie retired at around age 15, in 2014.</p><p>Unfortunately, even famous doggies don't live forever, and Moonie passed away in 2016 after a long and happy life of acting, as well as jumping in the purses of random people after learning the trick to work with Reese.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His trainer, Sue, commemorated Moonie upon his passing, noting that the personality-filled doggie lived a whopping 18 years. Reese also recognized her co-star's passing, saying she would never forget their time together.</p><p>In earlier interviews, Witherspoon had nothing but praise for the pup, who learned how to act alongside the star. She said Moonie was great, explaining that "He comes in, hits his mark, we shoot the take, and he goes back to his trailer."</p><p>The little pup, who was rescued from the pound as a puppy, turned out to be such a star that his role in 'Legally Blonde 2' was upgraded -- and his wardrobe expanded -- to suit fans' clamoring for him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After all, puppies have always been a staple on screen, and Moonie AKA Bruiser was another star worthy of recognition.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner & Other Celebs Who Are Dog Lovers For Life</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq7RrqCsnaJixLC7w6xkn6qfonqtscaao6WxXZe5sLrDnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
