Instead of directing a full-length movie, they create a short film that relates to the music. Artists have worked with and continue to work with music video directors to create videos for their songs that help increase the sales of both their singles and albums.</p><p>The best music videos are not necessarily the high-budget ones. Sometimes it is the <a href=#>lower-budget videos</a> that garner the most attention. It all comes down to making audiences feel something when they watch the video.</p><p>Some directors have started out directing music videos before they moved on to larger projects, with a few of them even having massive success with movies.
