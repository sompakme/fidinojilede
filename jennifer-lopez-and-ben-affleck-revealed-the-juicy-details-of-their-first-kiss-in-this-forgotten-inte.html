It was terrible to learn about J. Lo and Affleck's 2004 split and thrilling to watch them fall back in love many decades later. Since <a href=#>Affleck and Lopez remained friendly</a>, it's no wonder that they not only reunited but got married.</p><p><a href=#>Music </a>superstar <strong>Lopez and Affleck starred in the 2003 movie Gigli </strong>together, and they started their relationship after realizing how well they got along.

The pair answered a question about the first time that they kissed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/has-ben-affleck-s-marriage-to-jennifer-been-good-for-his-career_.jpg><p>The couple shared that their first kiss happened on camera since their Gigli characters kissed. When asked to describe that moment, Affleck got a little flustered and didn't seem to know what to say at first. The reporter said:</p><p>"People are going to watch this movie and try to figure out if you're in love."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Affleck agreed that fans would be interested in watching Gigli "for that reason" and understood it "was part of the attraction." He said he was mostly thinking about "trying to make the scene work, trying to make it good." Although the actor has since made some comments about the movie that suggest that he didn't end up loving it, he sounded proud of it at the time.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/was-one-of-jennifer-lopez-s-biggest-successes-stolen-from-mariah-carey_-front-deposit-back-commons-licenses.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Was One Of Jennifer Lopez's Biggest Successes Stolen From Mariah Carey?">Was One Of Jennifer Lopez's Biggest Successes Stolen From Mariah Carey?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Mariah Carey might have a really good reason to resent Jennifer Lopez which most of both women's fans don't know about.</p><p>While Lopez and Affleck have spoken a lot about their 2021 reconciliation and how happy they are to be back together, the details of their first kiss have definitely gotten lost in the shuffle. Although an on-camera kiss isn't likely as romantic as one that happens in the real world, it sounds like the stars had a solid connection and, at the very least, knew that they enjoyed spending time together. Since <strong>Lopez was married to Cris Judd in 2002</strong> when she met Affleck, Lopez and Affleck didn't start their relationship right away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-at-the-flash-premiere.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Ben Affleck's Ex-Girlfriends (According to Page Six)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Lindsay Shookus (2017-2019)</strong></li><li><strong>Jennifer Garner (married 2005-2018)</strong></li><li><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow (1997-2000)</strong></li><li><strong>Ana de Armas (met in 2019, broke up in 2021)</strong></li></ul><p>Gigli doesn't have the best reputation in Hollywood with many noting its poorly constructed story and characters who don't feel well-developed.

They answered a question about their first meeting, which took place at the inaugural read-through of Gigli. When asked about when they developed feelings for each other, Affleck said:</p><p>"You can't pinpoint that. We became friends first."</p><p>Affleck added that they developed a friendship in the beginning and said, "Because the whole thing was totally off limits, you know, we did end up becoming friends...

She shared that they were thinking about their "commitment" and it didn't sound like they wanted a fancy wedding with too much fanfare. While it's sad to think that they would break up just a little while later, at least they found their way back to each other and got married eventually.</p><p>At the end of 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lopez talked about Ben Affleck</a> when she was interviewed for Vogue and also posed for the cover. She explained that when Ana de Armas and Affleck split up, Affleck reached out to her via e-mail and they began talking again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lopez said that she always knew that there was something unique about her connection with Affleck.
