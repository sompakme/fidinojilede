It used to be, ‘I’d hold your hand and take you to the park.’ Now it’s like, ‘How do I mother you?’ Figuring that out. And how do we exist in this new space?”</p><p class=p1>While Hudson has enjoyed watching her son grow up, she’s made sure to be “cautious” about dating for David’s sake.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><b>“</b>My mom didn’t believe in having just anybody around her children, and I’m the same way. I’m extra careful and cautious,” she told the magazine. “I also know that, as a kid, you don’t want to see your mama with nobody. So I’m very sensitive to that. It took a long time to date. Because obviously, my focus has been on my child. It’s always about the energy of who you’re bringing into your circle. I’m very funny and sensitive about those things.”</p><p class=p1>Common, meanwhile, has previously been linked to <strong>Erykah Badu</strong>, <strong>Taraji P. Henson</strong> and <strong>Serena Williams</strong>.
