Tommy and Dina were married for over 10 years, however, the duo split in 2016 and it seems as if Tommy didn't take things too well.</p><p>Tommy Manzo is currently caught up in a scandal after having been arrested for allegedly hiring a hitman to hurt Dina's current boyfriend, David Cantin. This is certainly one big messy situation, and we're diving into it right now!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>RHONJ: 10 Sketchy Facts About The Manzo Family That Recently Came To Light</a></span></p><h2 id=who-are-the-manzo-s>Who Are The Manzo's?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Dina-and-Carolina-Manzo-RHONJ.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When you're from Jersey, chances are you know who the Manzo's are! For any Bravo fans, then you definitely know who the Manzo's are. Caroline and Dina Manzo became nationwide household names after they appeared on Bravo's "The Real Housewives of New Jersey". Caroline, who is 10 years Dina's senior, is without a doubt the matriarch of the family! The two remained on the show together for only two seasons, however, all it took were two seasons for Caroline and Dina to fall out and not speak to one another for good!</p><p>Dina and Caroline's issues became a hot topic on the show, and while&nbsp;we'd love to get into that, their relationship is far too complicated to even know where to begin. While these two were prominent figures on the hit reality show, it appears as if their husbands are stirring up some drama in real life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dina Manzo was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">previously married to Tommy Manzo</a>. The two wed back in 2005 and filed for divorce as of 2012, however, their divorce was not finalized until 2016. Tommy Manzo also just so happens to be the younger brother to Albert Manzo, Caroline's husband. In this case, Caroline and Dina are not only sisters, but they were once upon a time sisters-in-law, too! So, where does this leave the scandal with Tommy and Dina?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>RHONJ: Everything Teresa And Joe Have Been Up To Since Their Split</a></span></p><h2 id=a-real-housewives-scandal>A Real Housewives Scandal</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Tommy-Manzo-Dina-Manzo-Mob-hit.jpg><p>During her separation from Tommy, Dina began dating her now hubby, David Cantin. In 2015, Cantin was attacked and then in 2017, the year Dina and David got married, their home was broken into and robbed. Now, in 2020 it appears as if Dina's ex-husband is now being charged federally for having hired a Lucchese crime family soldier to attack Cantin back in 2015. Additionally, Tommy was known to be quite "upset" when he found out about Dina's relationship with David, which can be considered a motive, in this case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Earlier this month, Tommy Manzo pleaded not guilty to the federal charges, however, many people aren't buying it. The Manzo family has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tied to illegal activities for quite some time</a>. It all began with Tiny Manzo, Albert and Tommy's father, who was allegedly known for spending time with the wrong people. What caused the suspicions to grow was when Tiny Manzo was found dead in the trunk of his Lincoln, completely nude.&nbsp;While nothing has ever been proven, who knows where this current case against Tommy Manzo will go...</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Lauren Manzo Learns That Fame From The Real Housewives Comes With Pitfalls</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipoaeen3q1tMRmq6utpJ16oq7OrqtmnJmjrm6tzZ1kraedosZuucCnsairXaeyra3Toqanq5ievW6w0Zqkmmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
