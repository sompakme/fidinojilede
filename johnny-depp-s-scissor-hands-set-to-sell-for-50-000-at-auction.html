So far, the intimidating glove has received three bids, with the highest coming in at $20,000. The bladed glove, which is said to have exhibited extensive wear and aging, includes a letter of authenticity from Richard Landon, the film's mechanical department coordinator.</p><p>The auction&nbsp;comes on the heels of the Pirates of the Caribbean&nbsp;star's&nbsp;big court win against his ex-wife, in which <a href=#>a jury ordered Heard&nbsp;to pay the actor&nbsp;$10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages</a>. However, a judge later reduced the punitive damages to $350,000 per Virginia law.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During a recent sit-down interview with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie, Heard asserted that the Jury witnessed a performance by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a“fantastic actor” who “convinced the world he had scissors for fingers.”</a></p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Spending Thousands To Watch Johnny Depp Trial In Person</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PropStore</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DailyMail</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3sLTNp7BmnJWlvbR50pygrKufp3qprc2dqmarlal6tbuMrJylpF2bvLN5lGlnaWhdlsFurdScq6KnnmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
