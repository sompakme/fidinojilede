The two artists shared their perspectives on the supposed altercation this week.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “<a href=#>City Of Gods</a>” rapper stopped by <a href=#>Devin Haney</a> and <a href=#>Ryan Garcia’s</a> highly anticipated bout on Saturday (April 20) at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, NY. Allegedly, he ran into Connect outside of the venue, and their rumored tension boiled over.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Footage surfaced online showing Foreign’s entourage pulling him away from what looked like a scuffle. In a later scene, one of his friends was taking a selfie video and bragging about how the drill rapper “put blood in that ni**a’s mouth.” Foreign reiterated the claim and said, “You see my face and my chains,” indicating that he didn’t take any wounds in the fight nor did he lose any of his possessions.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Finally, the last scene in the video shows Fivio Foreign getting physical. He threw a few punches before being escorted away by security, though it is unclear whether the video was posted with the scenes out of order or if he was pulled away from the altercation a second time.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Either way, the <a href=#>Pain & Love 2</a> rapper believed that he walked away the victor. “Betchu that big bozo ni**a won’t go live about how I punched him in [the] face outside the [Barclays Center],” he wrote in an Instagram Story. “This why I don’t care to respond to none of these tough guys.. Boy said, ‘Wait that’s my brother.’ Ni**a we ain’t brothers tf. I would post the vid of boy running but I don’t condone internet movies. New Music coming soon.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ether Da Connect countered this post by saying that Foreign was using this drama to boost his music career. He also hinted at his former friend’s decision-making not being the best due to his drug use. “All I’ma say is cocaine is a helluva drug,” Connect said in a video on his Instagram Story. “That’s all I’m saying. Listen, y’all take that and y’all do what y’all want to do with that. God bless.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ion do internet shows or texting..</p>— Fivio Foreign (@FivioForeign) <a href=# rel=nofollow>April 22, 2024</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ether Da Connect doubled down on his perspective of the situation by posting a short clip of the alleged fight. He laughed it off and downplayed the situation, writing, “My Boi Was Fighting Himself.” As if that wasn’t enough, he then seemingly accused Fivio Foreign of intentionally having this footage posted online so that police could become aware of what went on.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“A LOT OF NI**AS POST SH*T ON THE INTERNET CUZ THEY TRYNA LET POLICE KNOW WHATS GOING ON PURPOSE,” he wrote. “DON’T LET THAT GO OVA YA HEAD!!” Foreign, on the other hand, resolved to not mention the situation anymore with one simple tweet: “Ion do internet shows or texting.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">It is unclear what sparked this feud between two guys who were well-known friends. Just a few months ago, Connect was asked about his rumored issues with Foreign earlier this year and gave a somewhat dry answer: “I don’t wish bad on nobody.” While that could very well be true, it is also possible that he held ill will toward Foreign and simply chose not to actively fan the flames. It seems that may not be the case anymore, but there are three sides to every story.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5u2t7XOZp2oqpWetK95xK2fnqpdma5ur86npZ6bpGKxqr%2FHZpilpJWcsqV5wauYsKRdZn90gJdwaWxtY2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
