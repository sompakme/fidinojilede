That was probably like my 10th match ever. So that’s crazy. She saw me at a very, you know, not experienced level. And then with the eye patch, I couldn’t see. I wasn’t confident. I didn’t know what I was doing.</p><p id=Rwr0Dk>“So, she’s seen me at some really weak points, but now I feel like I’m just climbing up the ladder, getting more and more up there. I’m feeling so good right now. Last Wednesday when I wrestled Willow, after it, I was like that’s what I’m supposed to feel like after a match. I’m feeling really good.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqZ3BrZmK3trjImmShmaKpeqK6w2ajnp1dn7yputKopWarlal6tbuMrZiknV2ptq6xjKidn2WWp7yuecCermaqn50%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
