It was like, ‘You’re not going to be alone. I’m not going to be alone. Let’s go out there and do this together.’”</p><p>Matt explained how the dynamic worked – whenever any of them scored a role, they would put their earnings into the joint account to go towards future audition costs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor added that the rules about the account were flexible for a time. “You were allowed to go to [auditions in] New York with the money,” he went on. “You were allowed to take out $10 and get quarters and go to [the arcade] and play video games.”</p><p>However, he admitted that things eventually started getting complicated. By the time they started earning a stable income, the friends closed the account.</p><p>Ben and Matt’s friendship goes beyond their early acting careers. They actually met in childhood when their mothers introduced them; Ben was 8, while Matt was 10.

It was, like, everything was exciting,” Ben went on. “So, we lived in Glendale and Eagle Rock and we lived in Hollywood, West Hollywood, Venice, by the Hollywood Bowl, all over the place. We’d get thrown out of some places or we’d have to upgrade or downgrade depending on who had money.”</p><p>With their huge success in Hollywood, the actors have no need for a joint bank account.
