Their romance quickly blossomed, and by January 2019, Pratt announced their engagement on Instagram.</p><p>They married a few months later in an intimate ceremony in Montecito, California, surrounded by close family and friends. This marriage was Pratt's second; he was previously married to actress Anna Faris, with whom he shares a son, Jack, born in August 2012. For Schwarzenegger, however, this was her first marriage.</p><p>The couple welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Lyla, in August 10, 2020. Their joy doubled when they announced the birth of their second daughter, Eloise, on May 21, 2022.</p><p>Aside from their growing family, both Schwarzenegger and Pratt have had notable careers. Katherine is an author known for her books on self-help and children’s literature, while Chris Pratt has starred in major film franchises like Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-katherine-has-said-about-being-a-mother>What Katherine Has Said About Being A Mother</h2><p>The couple often share glimpses of their personal life on social media, despite keeping their daughters’ identities relatively private.

In a 2021 essay, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">published on her mother’s website, she wrote</a>, "When I became a mother, I felt like everything in my life had led me right to that baby being put on my chest, and it was perfect.”</p><p>"Embarking on this new chapter of motherhood allowed for a new blossoming of a part of my relationship with my own mother,” Katherine continued.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chris-pratt-looking-annoyed.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Every Chris Pratt Movie That Made Over $100 Million At The Box Office">Every Chris Pratt Movie That Made Over $100 Million At The Box Office</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Chris Pratt's ability to tackle a wide range of movie genres, from science fiction to animation, demonstrates his versatility as an actor.</p><p>"I have always had an immense amount of respect for my mom, but since becoming a mother myself, my respect and admiration for her is out of this world. I ask her questions every single day, not just about motherhood, but about marriage, work, friendships, parenting and so much more. I know how lucky I am to have her,” she continued, explaining how inspired she was by her own mother.</p><p>"I hope to be half as perfect of a mother as she is," Katherine continued.
