They’ve managed to fire a man who has proven himself at the very top and hire a relatively new face. Let’s take a quick look at Solihull-born Graham Potter, the new Chelsea head coach. Born on Born on the 20th of May 1975, this manager began as a player with Birmingham City. He got his first big break with Stoke City. A quick stop at Southampton was followed by time at West Bromwich Albion. Potter has also played for Wycombe Wanderers, Northampton Town, Reading, York City, Boston United, Shrewsbury Town, and Macclesfield Town in England’s professional leagues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wtfoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/grpoperp.jpg><p>As a coach, he started out with Leeds Carnegie F.C., a team that was associated with the Leeds Metropolitan University. This coach made a name for himself in Sweden by leading Östersunds FK to heights they’ve not known before. A return to the UK saw him manage Swansea City for one season before Brighton & Hove Albion came calling. The man from Solihull presided over them in 135 matches in all competitions. He was appointed by the London-based side as the top man on the 8th of September 2022. We hope he is given ample time before the top brass comes to a verdict on him.</p><h2 id=graham-potter-wife class=rb-heading-index-1><strong>Graham Potter Wife</strong></h2><p>This Brit is happily married to a woman named Rachel. Potter began dating Rachel when he was a player in the 1990s. She is a Pilates enthusiast and has her own successful business too. This woman has been the football manager’s rock through the years. In fact, Rachel ditched her first business in the UK to start all over in Sweden when he landed the Ostersund position in 2011. Not a lot of women would do that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wtfoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/grapowf.jpeg><h3 id=who-is-graham-potter-currently-dating class=rb-heading-index-2><strong>Who is Graham Potter currently dating?</strong></h3><p>Graham has his hands full. On top of that, he has a beautiful thing going on with Rachel. She’s the one he’s currently dating now. Honestly, he’s not going to do any better than her.</p><h2 id=family-parents-siblings-amp-children class=rb-heading-index-3><strong>Family: Parents, Siblings & Children</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wtfoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/grapoimp.jpg><p>Val and Steve Potter are our manager’s parents. Sadly, both his parents are no more. Graham’s mum passed in 2019, whilst his dad died a year later. We heard that they were very encouraging of his football ambitions. They even supported him when he decided to call it quits on his career sooner than most people. There’s no publicly available info about Graham Potter’s siblings. He has three kids with Rachel. Charlie, their son, was born in England. The couple also has twins named Sam and Theo, who were born in Sweden.</p><h2 id=graham-potter-salary-amp-net-worth class=rb-heading-index-4><strong>Graham Potter Salary & Net Worth</strong></h2><p>This young man’s first salary in football was about 17,000 British Pounds a year. Graham has come a long way since then. Thanks to his hard work and ambition, he has been rewarded with a contract that will see him make over 50 million Pounds over the next five years. That’s about $56 million, approximately. His current net worth is estimated to be about $5 million.</p><h3 id=how-much-does-graham-potter-earn-per-year class=rb-heading-index-5><strong>How much does Graham Potter earn per year?</strong></h3><p>This manager will make about $11.2 million a year with Chelsea. That’s more than enough to lead a comfortable life. We’re not sure if he makes any money from endorsement deals, though.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wtfoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/grapwft.jpg><h2 id=unknown-facts-about-graham-potter class=rb-heading-index-6>Unknown facts about Graham Potter</h2><ul><li>Did you know that he won the Swedish Football Awards Manager of the Year award in 2016 and 2017?</li><li>He also won the Swedish Sports Awards Coach of the Year award in 2017.</li><li>Potter won the Division 2 Norrland in 2011, the Division 1 Norra in 2012, and the Svenska Cupen in 2016–17 with Östersund.</li><li>Did you know that he holds two Uni degrees?</li><li>Between 2006 and 2007, Graham worked as technical director for the Ghana women’s national team.</li><li>This manager’s overall win percentage so far stands at 43.7%.
