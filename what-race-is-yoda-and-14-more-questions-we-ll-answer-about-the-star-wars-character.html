For three years, Yoda led the Republic’s military effort trying to end the conflict once and for all. However, his efforts were stopped by Darth Sidious, the dark lord of the Sith aka Emperor Palpatine, who conspired to destroy the Jedi and put the Sith back in power.</p><p>Yoda also sensed Anakin Skywalker’s anger and fear years before the young talent became a Sith himself, he warned against training him, but did little else to avoid future problems. Yoda’s feats are tremendous and many, but where did he come from? What affiliation does he have with Baby Yoda? How powerful is he? We will attempt to answer these questions and many more below.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-race-is-yoda><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>What Race Is Yoda?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Yoda-Race.jpg><p>George Lucas explained that once he&nbsp;made the decision to kill off Obi-Wan at the end of A New Hope, he needed someone to take over for him. He said Yoda&nbsp;is a "mystery character, a magical character, he has no background, he comes and he goes, he's the subversive, secret, mysterious stranger that enters the film and then exits at the end."</p><p>When Disney bought Star Wars from Lucas, everything in the expanded universe was deemed non-canon, and it seems Disney isn't doing much to envision the origins of Yoda either.</p><h2 id=what-are-yoda-s-powers><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>What Are Yoda's Powers?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Yoda-powers-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Here are some if not all of his powers: deflecting Force lightning, telekinetically tossing aside metal pieces thrown at him, levitating huge stones and other heavy objects. His force powers allow him to destroy without using a lightsaber at all, he can basically reveal the history of a Force user just by touching them, telepathically converse with Jedis inside Jedi Temples, he had Force visions. Even as a Force spirit, he was able to summon a lightning strike.</p><h2 id=are-yoda-and-baby-yoda-the-same><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Are Yoda And Baby Yoda The Same?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Baby-Yoda-with-a-Lightsaber.jpg><p class=gnt_ar_b_p>The creator of The Mandalorian, as well as the head writer and showrunner Jon Favreau said "The series timeline takes place after 'Return of the Jedi,'" explained Favreau. "And fans of the original trilogy will remember that Yoda not only passes away but actually disappears. So Yoda exists as a Force Ghost." In other words, no, Baby Yoda is NOT Yoda.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-yoda-related-to-baby-yoda><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Is Yoda Related To Baby Yoda?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Baby-Yoda.jpeg><p>Jon Favreau says "Well, now you're getting into spoilers. I can't say. But there are a lot of theories about that." He also mentioned that the events in The Mandalorian take place after 'Return of the Jedi' and that by then, Yoda is a Force Ghost. This might mean that Master Yoda might show up at some point in time in The Mandalorian, perhaps to train Baby Yoda? It is entirely possible that they are related, but we don't know for certain.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Star Wars Characters Way Cuter Than Baby Yoda</a></span></p><h2 id=do-all-members-of-yoda-s-species-talk-like-yoda><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Do All Members Of Yoda's Species Talk Like Yoda?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Yoda-Talking.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether Yoda's way of speech is typical of the species is totally unknown, since nothing is typical of the species, and pretty much everything we know about the race is simply based on observations of Yoda himself. This is also true since another member of his species "Yaddle", doesn't speak at all, and whatever is seen of her doesn't reveal much either.</p><h2 id=who-is-yaddle-and-how-is-she-related-to-yoda><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Who Is Yaddle And How Is She Related To Yoda?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Yaddle.jpeg><p>Yaddle is a female of the same species as Yoda.

Yoda fought face-to-face against Darth Sidious in Revenge of The Sith, but wasn't able to complete his mission. This isn't exactly an apples to apples comparison, but it does suggest that Luke's power might have grown to some extent beyond Yoda's.</p><h2 id=how-powerful-would-yoda-be-if-he-gave-in-to-the-dark-side><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Powerful Would Yoda Be If He Gave In To The Dark Side?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Dark-Side-Yoda-e1582719578314.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Yoda has a natural power in the Force and centuries of fighting experience, this along with his knowledge of the Force, balance, wisdom, and empathy make him arguably the greatest Jedi in the galaxy.

People age, and Yoda is definitely on the old side, it would be easier to use a cane than to continuously use the Force.

Eventually, Yoda became a full-fledged Jedi, and was taken to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to further his training. This is also where he built his lightsaber and was promoted to Jedi Knight, as he took on several missions across the galaxy and improved his abilities in the ways of the Force.</p><h2 id=why-was-yoda-almost-worshipped-by-other-jedi><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Why Was Yoda Almost Worshipped By Other Jedi?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Yoda-Worship.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Since Yoda is almost 900 years old by the time of the films, we can correctly assume that for centuries, any low ranking or high ranking Jedi would have known him, maybe trained under him, he might have even trained generations of Jedi, telling people what their great, great grandmother used to say.
