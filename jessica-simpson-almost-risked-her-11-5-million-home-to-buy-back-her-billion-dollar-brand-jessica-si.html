The problem began when Sequential Brands Group Inc. purchased majority of the shares of her brand in 2015, leaving Simpson and her mom with only 37.5% stake putting her on the minority side. She was not at ease with the decision of someone taking over her company that is why in 2019 while in the hospital bed, she made the decision to get back what is hers. This began a two year battle between the Simpsons and Sequential Brands Group Inc.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kim Kardashian Is Officially Worth $1 Billion, Thanks To Her Business Empire</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The agreement between them was that Sequential Brands Group Inc. would continue to produce affordable lifestyle brand for the public such as shoes, clothing, fragrances and many more items for women. They promised Simpson that they would not expand under Sequential which was broken by the company. Her beloved company was put in a financial trouble and <a href=#>Simpson could not sleep peacefully</a> knowing that the business she created from ground up will be in jeopardy.</p><p>In an interview with the Bloomberg Businessweek, Simpson said that she was willing to do great length to own her brand again even if it means living in a tiny place somewhere in Ireland. The decision to buy back her brand came during the time when she was already struggling in her life. She was hospitalized in 2019 while she was 34 weeks pregnant because of severe bronchitis and her daughter’s health then began to deteriorate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added that her daughter’s oxygen level continues to drop and she herself could not breathe properly.<a href=#> Jessica Simpson was hooked</a> on an oxygen machine at the time; fortunately her health as well as her daughter’s has stabilized.
