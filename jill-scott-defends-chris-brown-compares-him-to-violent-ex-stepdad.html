Early Sunday morning (April 21), the 52-year-old first praised the 34-year-old. “@chrisbrown is amazing. How does ANYBODY sing like THAT? Dance, look, Act and Rap… like THAT?,” Scott tweeted, continuing, “Beyond gifted. It appears, exceptional people have to go through exceptional. There’s nothing to debate.”
Fans quickly reacted to the singer’s tweet, mentioning that the women who’ve been abused by Brown would view him as anything but exceptional."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, Scott disagreed, referencing her mother’s ex-husband, whom she felt was “a mean, violent human” and a talented blue collar worker.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“My Mother’s ex husband was a mean, violent human AND he could lay foundation better than anyone in my city. What he did with cement was awe inspiring. We got away. He got a raise and praise for his ability. God dealt with the rest,” said the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=682562>mother of one</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-22-at-9.45.35 AM.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In regards to her former stepfather, she <a rel=nofollow href=#>explained</a>, “It means that even he had something to offer. He was sick/hurt and did cruel things. I forgave him because of his <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234813516>trauma</a>. Did I forget? Never. So I try my best to choose better. I’ve failed a few times but not in that abusive area.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-22-at-9.48.00 AM.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She credited her <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234781459>compassion</a> to “years of prayer, therapy, self reflection, & making every effort to keep my feet on the ground.” The “<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234713707>Golden</a>” singer <a rel=nofollow href=#>empathized</a> with people who “go through s**t and do terrible s**t.” Later <a rel=nofollow href=#>adding</a>, “No man or woman is above or below. We’re all human beings; Flawed & figuring it out.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Scott also condemned those who don’t forgive. “And I caution those who <a href=# data-type=post data-id=673553>refuse to forgive </a>because they will undoubtedly need forgiveness at some point in their lives. We’re all flawed and need help. Power to people who move past violence. The past is a terrible reminder AND the future is ours,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow>expressed</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-22-at-9.46.24 AM.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Scott doubled-down on her sentiments though, adding, “I’m not here to fight anymore else’s battles. If/since women hear the stories, they should avoid that street. Running backwards in moving traffic makes zero sense. Therapy for every damn body.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">However, after sparking a <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234772051>heated debate</a> with many considering her to be “out of touch,” Scott ended the topic of discussion with this: “Walked away, came back, googled, read tweets, listened to friends & considered the state of us as a whole. Some, lead with love (YOU gave me perspectives to consider & directive. THANK YOU ). Some a you ONLY want the highs of war. You may have your war.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Walked away, came back, googled, read tweets, listened to friends & considered the state of us as a whole.
