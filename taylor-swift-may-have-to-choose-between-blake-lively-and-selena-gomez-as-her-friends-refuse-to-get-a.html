Blake and Taylor first connected in 2015 while Lively was at the height of her Gossip Girl success. Now, Taylor has gone on to write songs referencing the daughters Blake shares with her husband Ryan Reynolds, showing just how close the two women are.</p><p>The same report from Life and Style says that Taylor and Blake enjoy each other’s company when they’re both down to party, whereas Taylor relies on Selena for more serious support and conversations. But apparently, Selena wishes she could have the same type of relationship with Taylor as Blake does, often appearing left out when partying is involved.</p><p>“Truth is, Selena’s insanely jealous of Taylor’s friendship with Blake,” the insider further explained. “Blake was on hand to help Taylor celebrate her birthday in December, and Selena was seething about it for weeks.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To conclude, the source again iterated that Taylor may be forced to pick between Selena and Blake in the near future, as she’s struggling to manage both friendships. “Selena and Blake are extremely petty sometimes and it stresses out Taylor,” they explained. “Either they start getting along or one of them will have to go!”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/selena-gomez-s-famous-boyfriends-ranked-by-net-worth-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Selena Gomez's Famous Ex Boyfriends Ranked By Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>A lot of outlandishly wealthy men have won Selena's heart, but which is actually the wealthiest?</span><p>In any case, Taylor is currently busy with her Eras tour, which has taken her all over the world this year alone, including Australia and Singapore. While it remains to be seen if any of her gal pals make appearances at her tour stops, <a href=#>Travis Kelce has been joining her for many concerts</a>, proving the two love birds are going strong, even if her friendships appear to be suffering at the moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lk528sL%2FEZpmerKeasq95waWYpJ1doba3scuyZKydnJq7onnGqKSesl2bv6qxzZ2qZqqVm8K0sYygnK1lkaG8r7OO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
