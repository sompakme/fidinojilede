Between <a href=#>getting married to the wealthy Bader Shammas</a>, the fact that <a href=#>she got pregnant</a>, and becoming a mother, a lot of attention has been paid to Lohan's personal life.</p><p>With Lohan adding a couple of members to her family, some fans have been thinking about the people who raised her and the ones she grew up with. That has resulted in it becoming clear that Lohan's relationship with her brother Dakota Lohan is very noteworthy in her family.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan-39-s-troubled-relationship-with-her-parents>Lindsay Lohan's Troubled Relationship With Her Parents</h2><p>At the height of Lindsay Lohan's career, she was among the most in-demand actors in the world. Sadly for Lohan, however, her public image and career took a lot of hits over time as gossip and reports about her troubled personal life began to garner a lot of attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lindsay-lohan-and-dina-lohan-looking-distant.jpg><p>At the time, it seemed like many in the media found it fun to report on Lohan's troubles. While that is a sad commentary on society at face value, it is even sadder knowing that Lohan's difficult childhood likely played a role in the actor's struggles.</p><p>In 2010, Lohan spoke to The Irish Examiner about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the destructive force her father was during her childhood</a>. "He's put myself and my mother and my mom's parents through so much hell. From the death threats to throwing shoes at my grandfather's head and giving him a concussion to threatening to kill my mother in front of my little brother Dakota."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While talking to The Daily Mail in 2016, Lohan claimed that her father loved getting attention so much that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he spread rumors about her</a>. "My father is known for talking to the press and selling stories. He loves the attention. In the past he's said I've done drugs, he put my number on the internet. Who does that? Some of the stuff he's done proves to me he doesn't care about me."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan's Net Worth And Career Would've Changed Forever Had She Not Missed Out On Starring In Friday Night Lights</a></span></p><p>Sadly, there is no doubt that Lohan's relationship with her mother Dina Lohan also has had its difficult moments. Most notably, there was an extremely unfortunate incident that took place between the mother and daughter.</p><p>One night in October 2012, Lohan and Dina Lohan got into a major fight after leaving a club. Distraught, Lohan called her father looking for help, and made several claims about her mother's behavior. Tragically, Michael Lohan opted to release a recording of Lohan calling him to the media which exposed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how awful the events of that night were</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since that horrible incident, Lindsay Lohan and her mother's relationship has seemingly become a lot better.</p><h2 id=is-lindsay-lohan-close-with-her-brother-dakota-lohan>Is Lindsay Lohan Close With Her Brother Dakota Lohan?</h2><p>Once Lindsay Lohan became a successful actor as a child, she began traveling to sets in a variety of locales. Still, as the tabloids would often reveal, there was no doubt that Lohan spent much of her time in The United States.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lindsay-lohan-1.jpg><p>In 2014, Lohan's life underwent a major change when she moved to Dubai after first traveling there years earlier. In the years since Lohan made Dubai her home, she has put down a lot of roots including becoming a wife and mother.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With Lohan moving thousands of miles from The United States, that obviously makes it more difficult for her to spend time with her American loved ones. With that in mind, it could be a lot harder for Lohan to maintain a relationship with her little brother Dakota Lohan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lindsay-lohan-s-nearly-unknown-brother-dakota-lohan-has-a-completely-different-relationship-with-the-star-than-the-rest-of-their-family.jpg><p>Fortunately for them, there is no reason to believe that Lohan has let distance damage her relationship with her brother. In fact, it seems like Dakota Lohan has an extremely close and positive relationship with his famous older sister.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan’s Movies Are Notorious For Her Bad On-Set Behavior, But These Films Were Also Total Box Office Bombs</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2022 and 2023, the Lohan brother and sister pairing gave fans a lot of reasons to think they are very close. Most notably, they have both used Instagram to chronicle how tight their bond has been and continues to be as their lives change.</p><p>In 2022, Lindsay Lohan uploaded a post on Instagram that proved that the more things change, the more they stay the same.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dakota-lohan-and-lindsay-lohan-looking-happy-together.jpg><p>In August 2022, Lohan posted a photo of Dakota Lohan lifting her in his arms outside Big Ben.</p><p>Alongside that image, Lohan included a photo from when they were both young in which she was holding Dakota Lohan in her arms outside Big Ben. Based on Lohan's caption, it was clear the siblings took the childhood photo when she was filming The Parent Trap.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dakota-lohan-lifting-lindsay-lohan-in-the-air-outside-big-ben-from-her-instagram-account-1.jpg><p>For his part, Dakota Lohan often uses his Instagram to pay tribute to his relationship with Lindsay Lohan. A perfect example of that is when Lindsay Lohan's movie Falling for Christmas was premiering on Netflix, her brother used Instagram to encourage fans to watch. More importantly, he took the occasion to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrate the people he has in his life</a>.</p><p>"I’m overwhelmed with joy and happiness. I can’t really put into words how amazingly beautiful people are and how grateful I am to have the people in my life that I have. Love y’all. Always be kind and show love and care for everyone. Side note watch my sister be a badass in her latest movie."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan’s Family Has Been All Over Her Since She Had A Baby, Despite Their Complicated Histo</a></span></p><p>Based on Dakota Lohan's Instagram posts, it seems like the Lohan family has become a lot closer in recent years aside from his father. After all, Dakota Lohan has several posts that show the times he has spent with Lindsay Lohan, Dina Lohan, and Ali Lohan altogether.</p><p>The thing that makes Dakota Lohan and Ali Lohan's relationship with their sister different is that they don't seem to have been a major source of drama for her in the past. With that in mind, it is wonderful to see that the siblings all seem to love being together based on the photos Dakota Lohan shares.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lindsay-lohan-with-her-siblings-dakota-lohan-and-ali-lohan-from-his-instagram-account.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By far the most compelling evidence that Lindsay Lohan and Dakota Lohan are close is what he posted on Instagram after she became a mother. After making his way to Dubai to meet his nephew, Dakota Lohan wrote about the experience on Instagram. In his caption, Dakota Lohan stated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he adores his eldest sister and is very happy for her</a>.</p><p>"Some recent Dubai moments. Ma best friends had a baby and he’s perfect. Okay love y’all enjoy your weekend 🩵💙💜. #smile #bekind #love".</p><p>In a separate Instagram post in which he wrote about going to see Lohan on a different occasion in Dubai, Dakota Lohan once again expressed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how much he loves his sister and her family</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Over the mooon. I’m basically speechless but here goes nothing. I got to see my best friends in a place I never thought I’d experience as in Dubai (hot as shit in the summer). They have the most precious little baby Luai who lights up their life and everyone who meets him. This trip to Dubai really put me in the best headspace and I’m beyond grateful for every single moment. Love y’all. Never stop being you 🤘🏼🕺🩵. #smile #bekind #love"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoqaUqK66ecuon5qmXZe%2FsMDHnqlmnJGgvLWtjKWmoZmeYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnFmqSipKlk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
