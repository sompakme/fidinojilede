During a recent interview with Dominic DeAngelo for AdFreeShows.com, Nick Aldis spoke about how the legendary actor ended up narrating the cold open to the NWA 73 pay-per-view. Aldis said that it was an important event for him as he was doing more behind-the-scenes in the NWA, and it’s something he wants to do more as he advances in his professional career."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Aldis said that it was an important event for him as he was doing more behind-the-scenes in the NWA, and it’s something he wants to do more as he advances in his professional career.</p><p>“I get as much pride — I’ll tell you this, it came up in conversation yesterday. We had some friends over and we were playing Cards Against Humanity, and [his name] came up. I said, ‘I love John Goodman. Did I ever tell you guys…’ and I told them about <a href=# rel=noopener>John Goodman doing the voiceover</a> for the cold open that I made for [NWA 73]. They were just like [blown away] and I said my friend Steve just threw it out there, ‘I could text John Goodman and he might do it.’ I’m like, ‘shut up…’ and then the next thing you know, I have an email in my inbox and it’s from John Goodman. ‘Hey Nick, I hope this is OK.’ [I was stunned] I just played it right there and I was shaking because John Goodman just read my script,” he explained. “I just wrote a voiceover script and John Goodman read it and now I’m going to make this cold open with him doing the narration for it. That’s nuts.</p><p>“When we put that out, I was so nervous about how that was going to be received because I was like ‘if this gets criticized, I’m not worried about myself. But what if — John Goodman did the voiceover for this thing, it can’t suck. Fortunately, it was really well-received, or I thought it was,” Aldis stated.&nbsp;“I get just as much satisfaction out of doing that sort of stuff as I do from working [in the ring],” Aldis said. “Professionally, I think that’s beginning to be a bit more well-known, which is good for me because as I start looking ahead toward the next five years, ten years, that’s definitely where I want to be focusing my efforts.”</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJtbGtpaWK7qq%2FKZpilnJmoequ7x6dkoKefmbqiuoynrpplZ2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
