After giving a shout-out to his fellow nominees, he shared some of the Critics Choice Association’s less flattering reviews of his work over the years.</p><p>“I was thinking this morning: I love critics,” he began. “They’ve given me such beautiful feedback, really just so many great moments, and some of it is so poetic, I just want to share some of their thoughts with you over the years.”</p><p>As the cameras panned to the audience during his speech, <strong>Bradley Cooper</strong>, <strong>Sandra Oh</strong> and more A-list stars were shown applauding and laughing. Even <strong>Robert De Niro</strong> looked amused as Downey Jr. continued.</p><p>“The first one is kind of like haiku: ‘Sloppy, messy, and lazy.’ The next one is more metaphoric: ‘Like Pee-wee Herman emerging from a coma,’” the Iron Man star read off a card in his hand. “This was from a Brit: ‘A puzzling waste of talent.’ And lastly, and this one lingered: ‘Amusing as a bed-locked fart.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Robert-Downey-Jr-Says-Acting-Was-Compared-to-Bed-Locked-Fart-While-Accepting-Critics-Choice-Award-2.jpg><p>Downey Jr. was nominated alongside De Niro, 80, <strong>Ryan Gosling</strong>, <strong>Charles Melton</strong>, <strong>Mark Ruffalo</strong> and <strong>Sterling K. Brown</strong>, who was also shown laughing along.</p><p>Downey Jr. took a somewhat more serious tone to his speech when thanking <a href=#>his “Oppenhomies,”</a> whom he worked with on Oppenheimer.</p><p>“Every day of filming was like having my ego’s ass handed to me at the door and it couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy,” he added, thanking the “holy trinity” of director <strong>Christopher Nolan</strong>, costar <strong>Cillian Murphy</strong> and producer <strong>Emma Thomas</strong>. He also offered a shout-out to cast members <strong>Emily Blunt</strong> and <strong>Alden Ehrenreich</strong>.</p><p>Downey Jr. concluded his speech by calling out the sources of his “24-hour running commentary” — otherwise known as his wife, <strong>Susan Downey</strong>, and his publicist. “I hope they think I did better this time. I’ll hear about it in a f—king second,” he concluded, seemingly referring to his recent <a href=#>Golden Globes</a> speech.</p><p>Downey Jr. took home another trophy for his Oppenheimer role at the Globes earlier this month.</p><p>“I took a beta blocker, so this is going to be a breeze,” he joked at the time, reading from a paper that he pulled out of his pocket. Along with thanking his wife and fellow castmates at the time, Downey Jr. referred to the award as a “most improved player thing,” seemingly joking about his ups and downs in Hollywood over the years.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While his career has had a recent resurgence, the actor struggled with addiction in his early Hollywood days. He has been <a href=#>drug-free since 2003</a>.</p><p>“Job one is get out of that cave. A lot of people do get out but don’t change,” he said, in part, during an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Vanity Fair</a> from September 2014. “So the thing is to get out and recognize the significance of that aggressive denial of your fate, come through the crucible forged into a stronger metal. Or whatever.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmompWnwW6wzrClnrFdn79uvsSam6xlmJ7AbrvWp2Srnaaesri%2FjKKlZpuinsGqr9JmmqGnmZiybr%2FPnpycoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
