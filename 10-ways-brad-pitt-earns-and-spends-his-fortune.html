When they traveled to Haiti following the nation's devastation by a terrible earthquake in 2010, it was one of their most significant acts of humanitarianism. Jolie and Pitt contributed $1 million to Doctors without Borders, a Haitian emergency response organization, to aid in the provision of healthcare to the country's citizens.</p><h2 id=earns-wine-production>Earns: Wine Production</h2><p>A new wine that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie invested in and marketed was unveiled in the spring of 2013; it was produced on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">150 acres of vineyard</a> on the Chateau Miraval, which is located south of their French home. The wine is called Miraval Rose, and the ex-original couple's run of 6,000 bottles distributed in shops worldwide sold out in just five hours. Customers believed the hype, and reviewers couldn't wait to gush about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spends-buying-a-superyacht>Spends: Buying A Superyacht</h2><p>If the price tag for a massive boat is outrageous, Brad Pitt and his then-partner Jolie spent an additional $200,000 simply to adorn their superyacht, which they purchased for a staggering $322 million. It is assumed that celebrities will go to whatever lengths to ensure that they can navigate the oceans of the world with <a href=#>the luxurious and extravagant superyacht</a>. We're too poor to comprehend. We know that sometimes it is preferable to travel across the sea than on a packed highway or a plane. Yachts are occasionally required.</p><h2 id=earns-film-production>Earns: Film Production</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Together with his then-wife Jennifer Aniston and movie producer Brad Grey, Brad Pitt invested <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">money in their own production business</a>, Plan B Entertainment, in 2001. By 2004, Aniston and Pitt had divorced, Grey had left the industry to take the helm at Paramount Pictures, and Pitt had emerged as the only shareholder. Pitt has invested in several successful ventures while using the company to flex his producing skills. Movies The Departed, Moonlight, and 12 Years a Slave were three of the company's productions that won the Best Picture in The Oscars.</p><h2 id=spends-acquiring-a-massive-villa>Spends: Acquiring A Massive Villa</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie purchased an 18,000-square-foot palatial home for themselves in the Italian region of Valpolicella in 2010. The Italian villa has two swimming pools, a home theater, a vineyard, eight baths, and 15 bedrooms. The family decided to buy the property because they fell in love with Italy while Angelina Jolie was filming her movie, The Tourist. They spent $41 million on their acquisition.</p><h2 id=earns-acting-career>Earns: Acting Career</h2><p>Even today, Pitt earns millions of dollars from his film roles. His portrayal of a 1960s stuntman in the <a href=#>prominent Hollywood director Tarantino</a>'s film Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood garnered him his first acting Oscar. Still, due to different payment procedures, his upfront payout for the movie was much less than the $20 million. Pitt also earned from major blockbusters like World War Z. Pitt undoubtedly isn't having financial trouble because his payout structure differs from film to film. Pitt is a producer as well.</p><h2 id=spends-foundation-with-angelina-jolie>Spends: Foundation With Angelina Jolie</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie launched the Jolie-Pitt Foundation in 2006.

He stayed at the Dogusevom Hotel while he was there. He spent some time talking to the building's architect, and that same architect later revealed to a local newspaper that Pitt had ambitions to develop his own hotel in Croatia. One of the ten individuals that accompanied Pitt on a walking tour of the area in search of a location for the project was the architect Nikola Basic. According to reports, the project cost $2.5 billion.</p><h2 id=spends-purchasing-a-winery>Spends: Purchasing A Winery</h2><p>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie paid $35 million for the French estate Chateau Miraval in 2008. There are 35 bedrooms within the chateau, and the road alone is three miles wide. A moat, vineyards, trees, and perhaps a forest encircle it. It resembles a palace from a fantastic book. It also turned out to be the best location for Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's decision to perform a private wedding ceremony there in 2014.
