Porizkova, 57, also gushed over the risky pic, writing: “And like a goddess, she laughs at the mortals.”</p><p>Through the years, Stone has been hailed as a fashion inspiration due to her dramatic red carpet looks and outstanding on-camera wardrobe. Her most memorable fashion moments are perhaps the eye-catching ensembles she wore in the 1992 thriller Basic Instinct.</p><p>Stone opened up about the clothes from the film in an essay for <a href=#>InStyle</a> published in February, revealing she <a href=#>kept every outfit</a> after production wrapped.</p><p>“People thought I was crazy, but the truth is I wasn’t getting paid much compared to my male costar,” the actress, who starred alongside <a href=#><strong>Michael Douglas</strong></a> in the Oscar-nominated movie, explained. “I made $500,000. Michael made $14 million. So, keeping my costumes was a really smart thing to do.”</p><p>The Beauty of Living Twice author shared that a handful of the items came from fashion houses like Hermes, while other looks were custom made. However, the most standout look — the timeless white dress from the interrogation room scene — was a piece Stone designed herself.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I remember asking the director, <strong>Paul Verhoeven</strong>, what he wanted me to wear for it. He jokingly said, ‘I don’t care if you wear a turtleneck and your hair in a bun.’ So, I said, ‘Good, because that’s what I was thinking,’” she recalled. “We decided go for all white because my character had a very Hitchcockian vibe.”</p><p>Stone worked with costume designer <strong>Ellen Mirojnick</strong> to execute the now-famous ensemble. “Ellen designed the dress so that I could sit like a man if he was being interrogated. It gave me the ability to move my arms and legs, take up space and exercise control over a room full of men,” Stone added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6i1or7Op2SsrJ%2Bjsm6%2Fx6iurGWfm7NutMSrZJ%2BhpGK9qcXSoqiunV2eu27AyKewZpqZoLavtYypn6isn2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
