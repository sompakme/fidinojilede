Even Star addresses that, who lives a lavish life 24/7.</p><h2 id=let-s-get-into-it>"Let's Get Into It"</h2><p>"Miss Jennifer Lopez, she's dropped her full motherf*cking skincare line," Star announced on his Instagram stories, "Now the price points, are a little cuckoo, but it's f*cking JLo b*tch. She's an icon!"</p><p>Cuckoo is true, as&nbsp;her "That JLo Glow" multitasking serum is $119. Its ingredients include a trademarked&nbsp;JLo Beauty™ Olive Complex,&nbsp;Japanese rice sake ferment, yeast-derived ferment, and niacinamide.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Ben Affleck Regrets Starring In Ex Jennifer Lopez's Video For 'Jenny From The Block'</a></span></p><p>Star continued, "I'm going to spare y'all the waste of time and I'm<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> going to buy them all. </a>I'm going to buy every single product here b*tch.

The honest <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reviewer of products</a> won't hype up a cleanser simply because a musical sensation's name is attached to it.</p><h2 id=analyzing-the-line>Analyzing The&nbsp;Line</h2><p>Although JLo Beauty appeals to a high-end market, the collection is also on the smaller side. That may hint at more time and care dedicated to each item, ensuring their quality. There are seven products altogether.</p><p>Star recorded his online shopping list for Instagram viewers to prove that he indeed bought everything, and is not sponsored by Lopez's team.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Where Do Kat Von D And Jeffree Star Stand Today?</a></span></p><p>Purchasing the entire JLo Beauty Line would total up to a little over $400, not including tax and shipping rates. Star is enticing his fans with the lingering questions of whether the awaited skincare will be a hit or a flop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>JLo followers are delivering mixed reviews about her business venture. Some are bragging about going bankrupt after purchasing her products while others are telling fellow fans to not waste their money.</p><p>Will it be the best celebrity moment to arise in the beauty community since Rihanna's FENTY launch?
