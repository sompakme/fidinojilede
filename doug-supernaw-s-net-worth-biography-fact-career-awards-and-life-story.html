A post on the singer’s official Facebook account gave an overview of his condition: “After struggling with a prolonged cough, Doug was admitted to the hospital on January 25th, where it was determined he was suffering from Pneumonia. Additional tests found fluid on his heart and lungs which put his heart in an A-Fib condition. Additional tests also found a suspicious mass in his right lung. It was then determined that it was in Doug’s best interest that he be transferred to another Houston area hospital. It was at this hospital that his medical team confirmed several masses in his lungs, lymph nodes, bones, and bladder. The official diagnoses as of now is advanced, stage four, lung and bladder cancer. At this time, Doug remains in the hospital, awaiting more testing, while determining a treatment path.”</p><p>In October 2020, he was transferred to a hospice after the cancer tragically spread to his brain and spine. A statement released on his official Facebook page at the time said: “Hello everyone, I know it has been a long time since any real update, and for that, I appreciate your understanding. I have been hoping to not have to pass this information on to you, but, Doug’s cancer has spread to the brain and spine, and he is now under hospice care. I will update as much as I am able to; until then, please keep Doug in your thoughts and prayers, as you have been.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cause-of-death></span>Cause of Death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Doug Supernaw’s cause of death was lung and bladder cancer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Doug Supernaw’s net worth was estimated to be $1 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fmby2s4ysrKmdoqOuuL%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jJugqJ%2Bilr2pxYyfmJysXZius7HEq2Sar5GnsbR5wKebZqSZm7Juv9OoqbJn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
