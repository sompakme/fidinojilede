Soon after saying this, singer and actress&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena Gomez</a> started trending on Twitter, and people couldn't&nbsp;help but talk about the insane amount of pull the YouTuber must have to accomplish such a thing as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The other users who speak in the videos are anonymous, but it was Dream who said these statements about Gomez. As the conversation continued, other users began to play older songs by Gomez while still playing the game.</p><p>Dream&nbsp;created his YouTube in 2014, and went on to have six more YouTube channels within a seven-year span.

The 2009 song "Naturally" became Gomez's breakout hit, leading to other now-classics such as 2010's "Round & Round" and 2011's "Who Says." Even though none of these songs came close to being number one hits, they are considered to be Gomez's "cult classics."</p><p>Although Gomez was the artist that saw the most&nbsp;trending power from the stream, she wasn't the only one.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paramore</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonas Brothers</a> also began to trend because the YouTuber mentioned their music from that era.
