Of course, once they embark on the trip, viewers are treated to a variety of comedic turns, from the women taking cannibas edibles to joining a celebrity poker game and more.</p><p>Check out the current net worth of actors and actresses that must have had a blast creating this comedy for their fans.</p><h2 id=billy-porter-4-million>Billy Porter – $4 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Broadway performer</a> has starred in productions of Grease, Jesus Christ Superstar and Little Shop of Horrors to name a few. He’s appeared in American Horror Story and released plenty of albums featuring his singing voice. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, the openly gay Porter has revealed he’s been diagnosed with HIV since 2007 and has continued to speak out for the LGBTQ community.</p><h2 id=sally-kirkland-5-5-million>Sally Kirkland – $5.5 Million</h2><p>She’s appeared in films such as Private Benjamin and A Star is Born but the star is also a minister and <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">teaches yoga</a> and meditation. In 1998, Kirkland launched the Kirkland Institute for Implant Survival Syndrome, advocating for women harmed by breast implants. In addition, she’s a known acting teacher who counts Liza Minnelli, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Sandra Bullock </a>and Barbara Streisand as students.</p><h2 id=harry-hamlin-10-million>Harry Hamlin – $10 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He is the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">husband of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Lisa Rinna</a>, but that’s hardly Hamlin’s claim to fame. We’ve seen Hamlin in episodes of Shameless, Mad Men, Law and Order, Glee and other popular television series. In addition to acting, Hamlin is an entrepreneur, co-founding Tri Alpha Energy (TAE Technologies), a company dedicated to developing aneutronic fusion power.</p><h2 id=rita-moreno-10-million>Rita Moreno – $10 Million</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">EGOT winner </a>brought some of our favorite classics, including Singin’ in the Rain, The King and I and The Night of the Following Day to the big screen. The 91 years old, Puerto Rican born actress made her debut in 1950, famously starring in the 1961 <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Broadway musical</a> West Side Story and has never stopped. The star has appeared in a variety of television shows and films, most recently, 80 For Brady. In addition to earning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony, Moreno is also a recipient of a Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Peabody Award.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">25 Classic Designers That Will Never Go Out Of Style (And New Brands That Will Take Over)</a></span></p><h2 id=lily-tomlin-20-million>Lily Tomlin – $20 Million</h2><p>Most recently, we’ve seen Tomlin and her co-star <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Jane Fonda in the Netflix series</a> Grace and Frankie, however, she has a career spanning 40 years of successful film, television and voice work. The natural comedian got her start in the late 70’s and early 80’s on shows like The Carol Burnett Show, Saturday Night Live and Murphy Brown. She’s worked alongside other strong, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">creative women like Dolly Parton</a> in 9 to 5 and Bette Midler in Big Business.</p><h2 id=sara-gilbert-30-million>Sara Gilbert – $30 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She’s known for her television role as Darlene Conner in Roseanne as well as the 2018 reboot of the comedy. However, Gilbert boasts a decade as co-host of the CBS daytime talk show she created, The Talk and has worked alongside Drew Barrymore, Ellen Pompeo and of course, John Goodman. Gilbert is the sister of Little House on the Prairie’s Melissa Gilbert and <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">graduated from Yale University</a> with honors. She provides a quick cameo in the 80 For Brady film.</p><h2 id=sally-field-55-million>Sally Field – $55 Million</h2><p>From The Flying Nun to Forrest Gump, Field has had <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">America’s heart </a>for decades. At 76-years-old, she continues to star in significant roles alongside Daniel Day Lewis in Lincoln and Peter Gallagher in Hello, My Name is Doris according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>. Even her love life has caught audiences’ attention with a late 70’s relationship with frequent co-star Burt Reynolds. Field has won two Academy Awards, two Emmys, two Golden Globes and many others.</p><h2 id=guy-fieri-70-million>Guy Fieri – $70 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We may not think of Fieri’s acting chops as much as his cooking ability, however, he does appear in a cameo for 80 For Brady. Fieri’s true claim to fame is hosting his own show on <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Food Network</a>, hosting Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and of course, his popular branded line of restaurants, sauces and retail merchandise. In 2021, he became not only the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">highest-paid television chef in the world</a>, but also the highest-paid television personalities in the world.</p><h2 id=jane-fonda-200-million>Jane Fonda – $200 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress, political activist and fitness expert began appearing on the big screen in the early 1960’s. She’s starred alongside Lilly Tomlin in numerous roles, including 1980’s 9 to 5 and most recently, Netflix’s Grace and Frankie. She and her father, actor Henry Fonda became the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">first father-daughter duo to be nominated for Oscars for their film</a>, On Golden Pond. Outside of film and television, Fonda has created a name for herself with a series of fitness books, videos and programs and it’s not uncommon to see Fonda picketing at her latest political protest.</p><h2 id=tom-brady-250-million>Tom Brady – $250 Million</h2><p>It makes sense that a movie about him would also include a cameo. The NFL quarterback recently retired (again) but has plenty in the works with a $375 million deal to join Fox Sports broadcasting, making a little more than twice as much as Tony Romo and Troy Aikman according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. In addition, his name appears as producer in the 80 For Brady film, so perhaps Brady is dipping his toe into another entertainment career in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">15 Actresses Who Would Be A Great Female James Bond</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMnJisrF2ks26Ej2adqKpdl7%2BisNhmqZqmm5qxbq7YZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
