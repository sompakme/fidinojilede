So they compromised: the Younger actress breast-fed her baby while feasting on Brussels sprouts. 
“@acrebaja was bomb,” Duff wrote on her Tuesday, January 1, Instagram, in which she is seen nursing and eating.
Earlier that day, Duff had asked her fans for advice on colic, a condition which is defined by the Mayo Clinic as “frequent, prolonged and intense crying or fussiness in a healthy infant."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Added another: “Brussels sprouts will make your baby gassy. I know you’re a super healthy eater, but cutting back for now on those will help.” A third recommended avoiding all vegetables from the Brassica family, such as broccoli and cauliflower.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Board-certified pediatrician <a href=#><strong>Dr. Jen Trachtenberg</strong></a> does not like to restrict what nursing women eat. “Babies are often gassy and crying because they are babies and it’s not food related,” the <a href=#>Pediatrician in Your Pocket</a> video host explained to Us Weekly. “Moms can unnecessarily end up on just bread and water from restricting so many potential gassy foods.”&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hilary-duff-breastfeeding-food-backlash-03.jpg><p class=p2><span class=s2>Though the “So Yesterday” singer and her boyfriend, <strong>Matthew Koma,</strong> are at their wits’ end, Dr. Trachtenberg promises things will improve soon. “Colic usually ends at about 3 months of age,” she told Us.

Dr. Trachtenberg recommends rubbing the child’s belly in circular motions while pedaling their legs in the air as if they’re riding a bike.
