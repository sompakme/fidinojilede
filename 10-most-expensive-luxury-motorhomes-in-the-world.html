The luxury of having your own vehicle with a bathroom, a kitchen, and all the other amenities that your house has makes adventuring in the wilds that much more enjoyable. Having space to lie down and legroom to stretch is a design feature that most RV drivers take for granted;&nbsp;the downtrodden students in their tiny, over-crowded Toyota with a 4-person tent packed into the trunk are likely at least a little envious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Recent years have seen a rise of bus-converted luxury motorhomes, transformations of buses into state-of-the-art mansions on wheels. While it’s true that most of the added features of these pristine machines certainly aren’t necessary, they're definitely enviable. If you're lucky enough to have the cash to burn&nbsp;and don't want to leave your luxuries at home while enjoying a road trip, why not indulge in some extravagant motorhome comforts? And who wouldn't want to roadtrip with friends in an RV that looks like a top-of-the-line nightclub? We might typically equate yachts and limousines with seriously high-class travel, &nbsp;but the following ten most expensive motorhomes on the market prove that the humble roadster can rival any of the most indulgent grown up toys in terms of extravagance and luxury.</p><h2 id=10-2015-entegra-coach-cornerstone-45dlq---464-000><strong>10. 2015 Entegra Coach Cornerstone 45DLQ - $464,000</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The gorgeous Cornerstone by Entegra Coach gives drivers a cab-forward design, including eight-way power seats and SmartWheel integrated steering to make the ride comfortable, while also offering advanced Mobileye and touchscreen technology. The elegant design includes a master suite with a cedar-lined walk-in closet, as well as a sound bar and entertainment system. The Cornerstone is detailed with quartz countertops, heated porcelain flooring, a walk-in shower, and much more. You could live very comfortably in this RV for quite a while, given its huge size and luxury fittings.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-country-coach-magna-630---495-000><strong>9. Country Coach Magna 630 - $495,000</strong></h2><p>This beautiful 40’ bus-converted RV was created by the luxury RV company Country Coach. It is powered with a 600HP Cummins engine, and it climbs over mountains beautifully when towed thanks to its power tilt and telescope wheels. The interior is decorated with walnut cabinets and earth tones, as well as a custom sofa, queen-sized bed, chairs, a washer and dryer, a dinette booth, and a tiled entry step. Solar panels on the roof of the RV keeps the power going inside, and the Magna also provides keyless entry with a touch pad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-unicat-amerigo-international---500-000><strong>8. UNICAT Amerigo International - $500,000</strong></h2><p>This RV looks a bit like a garbage truck, but its humble exterior is deceptive. The body doesn’t provide very much to look at in terms of “luxury,” but it’s the interior&nbsp;that counts here - and that adds up to half a million dollars. UNICAT calls its models ‘exploration vehicles,’ and this thing is one of the most rugged RVs on the market. So much so, in fact, that Jalopnik chose their vehicles as one of the best places to ride out a zombie apocalypse.</p><p>Built with solar panels and a 2,000-mile gas tank, the International can go coast to coast without stopping. Inside, there’s a kitchen, a master suite, desk space, and even a watermaker that can decontaminate water making it drinkable should you get stuck in a dire situation. Though it costs more than a small house, survivalists will attest that it’s worth every penny to be able to travel over such unruly terrain.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-2015-monaco-dynasty-45p---585-750><strong>7. 2015 Monaco Dynasty 45P - $585,750</strong></h2><p>Monaco is one of the industry leaders in luxury RVs, and the all-new 2015 Dynasty is their most ambitious creation yet. It features an all-new Roadmaster chassis with a 600HP Cummins engine, and its design drew on opinions from current Monaco owners so that the company could create a product inspired by their customers, for their customers.</p><p>Inside the Dynasty, every design is beautifully crafted; lined cabinets, an&nbsp;LED ceiling and a TV that can be controlled from the centralized command center, and a&nbsp;porcelain tile floor. The master bedroom comes with a king-sized Serenity Series memory foam mattress, surrounded by cedar-lined cabinets, walls, and wardrobes.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-2015-newmar-king-aire---738-645><strong>6. 2015 Newmar King Aire - $738,645</strong></h2><p>The Newmar King Aire will have you ruling the road and campsite like a king, built to showcase its luxury, innovation, and quality. It’s a Class A motor coach powered by a 600HP Cummins ISX turbo diesel engine, and supported by a custom-built Spartan K3 chassis. The RV features a Comfort Drive steering system with power control, and a Safety Cruise Collision Avoidance system to help you navigate through adverse weather and hazards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The entertainment system is illuminated by powered-awnings, and the spacious kitchen is chrome-finished with glossed hardwood cabinetry, giving all of its passengers the feeling of luxury. The residential decor is complete with two Villa sofas, a dinette ensemble, a washer and dryer, porcelain floors, and a master bedroom with a walk-in bathroom and overhead LED lighting.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-2014-country-coach-prevost---1-000-000><strong>5. 2014 Country Coach Prevost - $1,000,000</strong></h2><p>This RV isn’t for riding over rugged terrain or adventurous use, but it’s perfect for those who want to enjoy traveling in luxury between cities and towns. This converted bus is a great touring machine, with functional elegance, a sleek stainless-steel shell, and an aerodynamic profile. This motorhome, like many of the others on this list, comes equipped with porcelain tiled flooring, cedar-lined cabinets and walls, an entertainment system and beautiful master bedroom lined with quartz and a walk-in closet and separated bathroom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-2015-foretravel-ih-45-luxury-motor-coach---1-300-000><strong>4. 2015 Foretravel IH-45 Luxury Motor Coach - $1,300,000</strong></h2><p>Foretravel has been in the motorhome-building business since 1967, located out of Nacogdoches, the “Oldest Town in Texas.” The IH-45 is a 45’ luxury motor coach with completely custom and unique designs, such as the TravelRide chassis which emulates the construction of an airplane by distributing vibration through the subfloor, floor, walls, and roof for ultimate noise reduction. Other features that set it apart from the competition include a 20,000 kilowatt generator, slide-out rooms, a Knoedler air-ride pilot seat, 4 roof A/C units, and a steel constructed cockpit, walls, and floor. At over a million dollars MSRP, it’s no wonder that the IH-45 is gorgeous both in design and functionality.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-2015-prevost-h3-45-vip---1-600-000><strong>3. 2015 Prevost H3-45 VIP - $1,600,000</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Prevost H3-45 VIP is part of the H-series, one of two lines from the luxury RV makers at Prevost. The company describes it as the “sleek and modern” line, whereas the other series, the X-series is dubbed “timeless and classic.” True to their promise, the Prevost H3-45 is innovative and excellent. It is the tallest converted coach, standing at 12 feet 5 inches, giving unparalleled roominess, the industry’s highest cabin floor, and unmatched panoramic views for the driver and passengers.</p><p>The outer shell is made from a precision-molded fiber composite, giving the RV reduced weight and maximum strength. Inside, as expected, the H3-45 is decorated with a gorgeous, sleek glossed wooden floor, modern sofas, chairs, desk space, kitchen, and bedroom, and curved marble tables. All of the contemporary designs and features make this one of prettiest luxury RVs on the market.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-featherlite-vantare-platinum-plus---2-500-000><strong>2. Featherlite Vantare Platinum Plus - $2,500,000</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Featherlite spared no expense with the Vantare Platinum Plus, making sure that this is one of the most gorgeous motor coaches ever built. Inside, there are custom-built sculptures on the ceiling surrounded by Swarovski crystals, marble steps leading up to the cabin, rare Inca marble, copper, pearlized Italian leather, suede, antique bronze and onyx, and many more ridiculously expensive materials and decorations, making this a true mansion on wheels.</p><p>The master bedroom comes equipped with a king bed with a plasma TV that lifts out of the floorboard, bath hardware from France, a washer and dryer, and a built-in treadmill. The cockpit comes with state-of-the-art Avic N-2 GPS system with real-time traffic and weather alerts. On the outside, the RV even has a garage slide-out compartment that fits a sports car! The shell is made from a Prevost bus shell, and the gas tank holds 235 gallons, which costs around $1,000 to fill up.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-marchi-mobile-elemment-palazzo---3-000-000><strong>1. Marchi Mobile EleMMent Palazzo - $3,000,000</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The most expensive motorhome in the world truly looks like something from a futuristic Hollywood blockbuster. The cockpit wouldn't be out of place in a Star Trek feature, with a circular central window for panoramic vision. Marchi Mobile has said that the Palazzo’s design “unites characteristics from motor, yachting, and aviation sports.”</p><p>The fixtures inside are akin to those found in a luxury hotel, such as hand-cut wooden flooring, marble countertops, and even a staircase that leads to the vehicle’s upper deck. The design of the living room and the interior LED lighting gives the inside the vibe of a top-tier nightclub, complete with a full-length sunroof. The Palazzo is popular among oil-rich Arab Sheikhs, and according to Marchi Mobile, the minimalistic design uses “modern shapes fused with classy and antique design elements.” Both the interior and exterior of this motor coach is “just as extravagant as its owner.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5BpZKieXam1pnnMqKqtZZWtvaa60qKtnmWcqsW2vthmpKisn6e1sLnErGSipl2ptaZ51qippZxf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
