Q: Dear Khia, I’m always jealous of girls with natural hair because their man can pull it during sex. Is there anyway my man can pull my weave without me ending up bald?
KHIA: I don’t like my hair pulled on. I’ll keep my bra on where you can pull my bra strap and act like “giddy up, giddy up, giddy up”, but you better not pull my hair."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I’ll keep my bra on where you can pull my bra strap and act like “giddy up, giddy up, giddy up”, but you better not pull my hair. I can imagine a dude pulling and then he sees that real hair and it’s out the bag. Some weaves is $300, you don’t want nobody touching them! You going to have make sure that glue is extra tight or let him know ‘Yo this is a weave and do not pull, trust me.’ He’s either going to have to grab her around her throat or slap her on her ass. Something else… bite the girl.&nbsp;<br></span></span></span><span><br></span><span><span><strong><span>Q: Dear Khia, I’m sick of having sex in bed! What are my options? </span></strong></span></span><span><strong><span><br></span></strong></span><span><span><strong><span>KHIA: </span></strong><span>The beach is good, the rooftop is good. I go to a whole lot of clubs, where you can have a private room, you can have curtains, you can be somewhere you can see out, but people cant see in. Also, if you sneak away to the bathroom stall, that’s good. It’s according to what you like. I love it, but I’m a freak. The car is a no-no for me. There’s not enough room, it’s uckie-uckie, there’s nothing sexy about having sex in the car. You look like a hooker. It’s ugh. The beach is so hot because I love having sex outside, I love being able to see the stars and I love the water too. And some men need to get their dirty ass in that goddamn water and get cleaned out.<br></span></span></span><span><br></span><span><span><strong><span>Q: Dear Khia, Rihanna once said every girl should send naked pictures to her boyfriend. Is she right? </span></strong></span></span><span><strong><span><br></span></strong></span><span><span><strong><span>KHIA:&nbsp;</span></strong></span><span><span>That’s just tacky. And why would you give someone that ammunition to shoot it back at you when they’re over you and sick of you? You know they’re letting all their guys look at your vagina, thinking of you as the biggest whore in the world. Boys are going to be boys, but do they really want their queen to be sending them pictures of her vagina? No. Believe me, it will come back and bite you in your butt. Everything needs to be tasteful, so take a nice, sexy photo shoot and don’t be crass about it. If you’re just popping your leg up on the bathroom sink, that’s a mess.</span></span></span><span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Q: Dear Khia, my girl wants me to talk dirty in bed, but I’m not used to it… and frankly, she needs some work as well.
