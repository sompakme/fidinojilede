That said, he’s not keen to take on everything. Instead, Bassett seems to be going with what feels right, which may not exactly be what agents expected from the star.</p><h2 id=joshua-bassett-became-a-disney-star-after-playing-a-hsm-extra>Joshua Bassett Became A Disney Star After Playing A HSM Extra</h2><p>When he was much younger, Bassett landed a role in the hit High School Musical, but it was only for JV Jock #2. One decade later, he heard about his current show and knew <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he had to take his shot</a>.</p><p>“High School Musical was the first show I was ever in. When the audition came around, it just made sense,” the actor recalled. “It’s a dream.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Instead of the Disney Channel, Bassett found himself doing a High School Musical project for the then-new Disney+, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gave him a bit more anxiety</a>.</p><p>“It’s scary and exciting and everything in between. Obviously Disney has been around since all of us can remember and I didn’t have any doubts on the Disney side, but when you’re starting a new network, this new service, it can be a little intimidating, especially when you are adding on to this franchise that is this beloved,” he explained.</p><p>“The amount of people that told me: ‘Don’t screw it up’, I’m like: ‘Alright’. There is some pressure that comes with it.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Joshua Bassett's Fans Think He Is Entering His 'Reputation Era'</a></span></p><p>Fortunately for Bassett, he also had some previous acting experiences to pull from.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I took things from Grey’s Anatomy that I learned about being subtle and not necessarily having to overdo everything, then with Dirty John, you learn something every time and I think each thing has led me to where I am now,” he explained.</p><h2 id=these-days-joshua-bassett-has-been-turning-down-projects-lsquo-agents-hate-it-rsquo>These Days, Joshua Bassett Has Been Turning Down Projects: ‘Agents Hate It’</h2><p>Rising stars are typically open to all sorts of projects in the hopes of increasing their exposure. But Bassett isn’t a typical rising star, to begin with, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he’s happy to turn some offers down</a> even if people representing him are not.</p><p>“If I’m offered a movie for something that shoots for seven months, but I don’t really believe in or stand behind the message of that film, I’m not going to waste my time doing that because I could be spending seven months making music that I feel passionate about,” he said while also admitting that his “agents hate it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are Joshua Bassett’s New Songs About Olivia Rodrigo?</a></span></p><p>Also, to this day, Bassett also has no idea how much he’s earning from his hit Disney+ show. “I still don’t know how much money I’m making for High School Musical. That’s a true story,” he said. “I’ll tell my business managers ‘I don’t want to know. If I need to worry, let me know.’”</p><p>Bassett also revealed that the knows what it’s like to have nothing. “I’ve lived in my car with negative $1 in my bank account, so I’ve seen both sides of the coin and I choose not to let it dictate how I live my life,” he explained.</p><h2 id=joshua-bassett-is-never-motivated-by-money>Joshua Bassett Is Never Motivated By Money</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite his fame, Bassett likes to keep things simple. For starters, the actor/singer has kept his Civic around. “I like how a Civic is low key. It’s super easy to drive,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if you get a ding on it, nobody cares.”</p><p>At the same time, Bassett is proud to own only a single pair of shoes even today.</p><p>“I have Converse that are black and white. And they’re the only pair of shoes that I have, period,” he revealed. “I get overwhelmed with choice and I’m very much a minimalist. I like to keep it simple.”</p><p>It seems that Bassett has always known what truly matters, even a couple of years back when High School Musical: The Musical: The Series just started airing. Back then, he made it clear that his life “hasn’t really changed” despite his breakout role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Olivia Rodrigo’s Ex Joshua Bassett Opens Up His Past Regarding Abuse</a></span></p><p>“If anything, this show, filming it has changed me as a person and I’ve grown so much and all that, but I’ve still got a good circle in my life and I’ve still got my family, and as long as I’ve got those key things, whatever shifts around me doesn’t quite affect me because I have that core,” Bassett continued.</p><p>“But I keep my core and nothing else really matters too much.”</p><p>At the end of the day, there are a lot of things more important than money for Bassett. And also, he maintains that money has “no effect on happiness.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecmoqqGtkWKvor%2FSnqutZZSktq%2BzjKemsGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
