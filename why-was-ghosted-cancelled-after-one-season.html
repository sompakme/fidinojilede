Shows like <a href=#>Friends</a> make it look easy, but the truth is that the right show needs to be released at the right time and be seen by the right people to have any chance for success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shows get cancelled all the time in Hollywood. <a href=#>Some are cancelled due to controversies</a>, and other are cancelled because <a href=#>they're simply bad and have poor ratings</a>.</p><p>2017's Ghosted came and went without doing a whole lot, and we have the details behind its swift cancellation below.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-39-ghosted-39>What Happened To 'Ghosted'?</h2><p>In 2017, the folks at FOX thought that they had a major hit on their hands when they released Ghosted for small screen audiences. Bringing together Adam Scott from Parks and Recreation and Craig Robinson from The Office seemed like a wise idea, and tapping into supernatural elements added some intrigue to the series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the supernatural elements on the show, it was apparent that the show would draw comparisons to other notable supernatural shows, something that Adam Scott talked about in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Uproxx</a>.</p><p>"We never set out to be compared to any of those franchises, but I guess it’s inevitable. Ghostbusters is an obvious touchstone since they were able to so perfectly meld comedy and the paranormal without lifting too far off the ground. Aside from the guys and Rick Moranis, everyone else in that movie is in a drama, so the danger felt real — the stakes legitimately sky-high," the actor said.</p><p>Once the series finally hit the small screen, critics and audiences quickly began sounding off about their feelings toward the project, and this is something that played a part in shaping its future on TV.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Did 'The Bachelor' Spin-Off 'Bachelor Pad' Get Cancelled?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=critics-weren-39-t-kind-to-it>Critics Weren't Kind To It</h2><p>Over on Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds just a 59% with critics, meaning that many professionals weren't too fond of what the show was trying to accomplish each week.</p><p>Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazzette believed that the show simply was not funny enough during its first season.</p><p>"Sort of a comedic X-Files -- but only mildly amusing -- Ghosted needs to be funnier and less predictable if it hopes to win over TV viewers with thousands of options," he wrote.</p><p>Other reviewers felt similarly, and unfortunately, audiences weren't too impressed either.</p><p>Now, the audience score is at 70%, which is quite higher from the critics score. Even then, it was clearly not enough of a difference for the network to place any faith in the show moving forward.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One audience reviewer genuinely thought the show was funny, contrasting what Rob Owen had written in his review.</p><p>"Hilarious paranormal fun. I love the nerdy, insightful Max paired with the smooth, heart-warming Leroy. Great show for those who enjoy the X Files, but want to have a laugh."</p><p>When averaged out, Ghosted still ended up with just a 64.5% overall. Unfortunately, these lukewarm reviews did the series no favors, and it was axed from the network after its debut season.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason ‘Home & Family’ Was Canceled</a></span></p><h2 id=why-39-ghosted-39-was-cancelled>Why 'Ghosted' Was Cancelled</h2><p>So, what ultimately sank Ghosted? The reviews didn't help, but it was primarily the fact that no one was tuning in and actually watching it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, "Ghosted‘s cancellation had been considered a foregone conclusion but Fox postponed the decision until after the comedy returned for the remainder of its freshman season earlier this month."</p><p>"Described as a comedic X-Files, Ghosted, starring Adam Scott and Craig Robinson, had an OK ratings start in its October 1 premiere as a lead-out from The Simpsons but quickly lost steam. In late November, though, Fox ordered six more episodes of the paranormal action comedy and brought in Robinson’s former The Office co-star/EP Paul Lieberstein as new showrunner to oversee a creative shift toward grounding the show as more of a workplace comedy," the report continued.</p><p>Some shows can skate by on poor reviews, as long as it has a large audience, but Ghosted was never able to draw a large crowd. Even at its peak, it was only mildly successful. Because of this, Fox was quick to end the show and move on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Supernatural comedies are tough to pull off, but the ones that hit tend to get better reviews and better ratings than Ghosted. CBS' new series, Ghosts, for instance, has been a success, and it's already confirmed to be getting a second season.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These ‘80s Cartoon Characters Would Be Canceled In 2022</a></span></p><p>Ghosted was never able to become a hit for Fox, but thankfully, Adam Scott and Craig Robinson have gone on to do great work elsewhere.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Why Was Marvel's 'Inhumans' Cancelled So Quickly?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdrK60ecahpqyslZl6pK3NnJylpJWZeqKy056pZqeemnq0scCspqdn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
