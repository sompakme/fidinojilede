Some celebrities don't take criticism well, being that they are human after all. Even though famous people are public figures and their lives are on display, it doesn't mean that they are unbothered by what people have to say about them. So it makes sense that some celebs prefer to keep a lowkey profile. The less the public knows, the less the public can judge them. Here are ten celebrities who can't stand social media and the reasons behind their disdain for it.</p><h2 id=social-media-distracts-adele-from-her-songwriting-process><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Social Media Distracts Adele From Her Songwriting Process</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>, one of the reasons that the "Hello" singer doesn't like social media is that focusing on it makes it hard for her to put out a record. She shared that it's hard to put a record out when you're waiting for half a million photo likes. Adele, referring to Beyoncé's secret album drops, stated that she becomes bored when artists have a six-month promotional buildup for their albums. Oh, and if anyone talks about her family, she becomes protective. Adele does have an IG, but she doesn't post as much as some celebs.</p><h2 id=kristen-stewart-believes-that-social-media-is-time-consuming><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Kristen Stewart Believes That Social Media Is Time-Consuming</span></h2><p>According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harpers Bazaar</a>, Stewart feels as if there is a "massive disconnection" between real life and social media. The Twilight actress feels like people could be doing so much more with their lives because social media is time-consuming. If Stewart has something to say, she uses a loved one's account to announce it. In 2020, she did take over her girlfriend Dylan Myer's IG account to discuss the importance of voting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jay-z-finds-cancel-culture-toxic><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jay-Z Finds Cancel Culture Toxic</span></h2><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cinema Blend</a> discussed Jay-Z's rare interview with The Sunday Times, in which he revealed why he avoids social media. It's mainly due to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel culture</a> and the pressure always to say the right thing. Jay-Z also feels that sometimes people speak out on social media but won't speak up in real life. The "Change Clothes" rapper did join Instagram in 2015 to wish the late Michael Jackson a Happy Birthday. However, he deleted the account fourteen hours later. Jay does make the rare appearance on his wife, Beyoncé's IG account, and has a Twitter account but barely uses it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Some Fans Think Blue Ivy Isn’t Jay-Z’s First Daughter</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-jolie-refused-to-introduce-her-children-to-social-media><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Angelina Jolie Refused To Introduce Her Children To Social Media</span></h2><p>The Mr. & Mrs. Smith actress revealed that her kids are not on Facebook, and neither is she because of false news spreading about her and her children, making it hard for her children to trust and know who's telling the truth. Jolie also talked about how children must have exposure to unbiased, fact-based news. However, she also made it clear that she wasn't going out of her way to check their search history or block websites. There is a fan account on IG, but that's all.</p><h2 id=tina-fey-is-too-busy-for-social-media><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Tina Fey Is Too Busy For Social Media</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like Stewart, it appears that the former Saturday Night Live cast member Tina Fey finds social media time-consuming as well. Fey works a lot, and when she's not working, she wants to be present with her children. If Fey does have an Instagram account, it never received a verified badge, and the user for this account has created a post since 2014. It also doesn't appear as if Fey is active on Twitter either.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tina Fey Called This Reality Star “Awful” During Her ‘SNL’ Appearance</a></span></p><h2 id=sandra-bullock-didn-t-want-to-go-on-wine-fueled-rants><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Sandra Bullock Didn't Want To Go On Wine-Fueled Rants.</span></h2><p>In 2018, Bullock finally opened up to the idea of joining social media because she wanted to troll her celebrity friends. The Bird Box actress joked that if she had joined social media earlier, she would have had one glass of rosé and went on rants about what was true and what wasn't. Bullock also revealed being lazy and would prefer to try and get the hang of it when her kids use it because navigating it won't be as hard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bullock doesn't seem to have a Twitter account, and if she generated her IG account, it's unclear if it has a verified badge. On a more serious note, Bullock believes that people don't represent themselves online truthfully and that she doesn't want to take a selfie that she can't erase.</p><h2 id=mila-kunis-wants-to-keep-her-personal-life-separate><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mila Kunis Wants To Keep Her Personal Life Separate</span></h2><p>If you attempt to search for the Bad Moms actress on IG, you won't find her. Only fan account pages exist. It also doesn't appear as if there is a Twitter account. Kunis wants to differentiate who she is versus what she does. Kunis doesn't want people to feel like they know her so well that they could come into her home without being invited. She prefers her privacy and security matters to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=george-clooney-doesn-t-want-to-say-something-stupid><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>George Clooney Doesn't Want To Say Something Stupid.</span></h2><p>Clooney shared that he would never join Twitter in a Variety interview because he likes to have a drink at night. He revealed that he might say something "stupid," and he doesn't want to be that "available." He expressed that he doesn't see himself, Matt Damon, or Brad Pitt trying to tweet their thoughts in 140 characters or less at 3 a.m. He doesn't understand why famous people are on social media at all.</p><h2 id=daniel-radcliffe-wants-people-to-take-his-private-life-seriously><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Daniel Radcliffe Wants People To Take His Private Life Seriously</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Harry Potter actor genuinely does not want to get into fights with random people on Twitter. He also believes that when a celebrity posts every moment of their life and then claims to enjoy a private life, no one takes them seriously. He also believes that <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reading comments online about what people have to say about you isn't healthy</a>.</p><h2 id=eddie-murphy-laughs-at-those-who-seek-constant-attention-on-social-media><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Eddie Murphy Laughs At Those Who Seek Constant Attention On Social Media</span></h2><p>In the past, Murphy has urged fans to stop believing that imposters on social media are him. Murphy used to read all of the articles about himself at a point in time, but he shared that he hasn't read a newspaper in twenty years in later years. Murphy has even stated not having an email address or owning a computer. Murphy also joked that he doesn't need to be on social media interacting with fans or tweeting about how he just ate strawberries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Saturday Night Live’ Launched These 10 Celebrity Careers</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmq6Gdo5p6pLHLnpmsZZOWu7V50q2Yp5xdqLyktcClZKadlJ6ucA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
