The role that really showcased her talent after Disney was playing Rue on HBO's Euphoria. The show is a huge success and is loved amongst a lot of different age groups. Zendaya has been recognized for her talent on the show multiple times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from her professional life, fans follow along on her personal life as much as they can. She had done a pretty good job of keeping most details of her personal life quiet and out of the public eye but has recently been more open about it, including a recent scare that has her swearing off cooking forever.</p><h2 id=zendaya-has-kept-her-life-pretty-private>Zendaya Has Kept Her Life Pretty Private</h2><p>One of the aspects of Zendaya's life that fans were really curious about was her love life. Although she kept it private for a long time, after Euphoria she was photographed a lot with different people which got fans talking about who she might be dating. Zendaya starred in Spider-Man: Homecoming back in 2016, <a href=#>where she met co-star Tom Holland.</a></p><p>The two seemed to be really great friends for a many years after they met but fans most certainly thought they were in a romantic relationship rather than a friendship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Look Inside Zendaya's Harry Potter Obsession</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The timeline of their relationship is a little unclear since Zendaya was spotted with her Euphoria co-star, Jacob Elordi which sparked rumors that they dated from 2019-2020. <a href=#>The two never confirmed that they dated,</a> they never even commented on it. Even if they did date, Zendaya found her way back to Holland and the two are still together today.</p><p>Zendaya and Tom's relationship has been a little more 'out in the open'. <a href=#>Pictures of them sharing kisses in LA</a> came out and the two of them post pictures of each other on Instagram which finally confirms that the two are together. So it is possible that Zendaya is opening up more about her personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans don't care too much if Zendaya talks about super personal things, but it is nice for them to see their favorite share some of her life. Zendaya recently did that by sharing an experience she had in the kitchen that turned out pretty bad for her.</p><h2 id=zendaya-shared-her-wild-and-scary-kitchen-incident>Zendaya Shared Her Wild (And Scary) Kitchen Incident</h2><p>She shared photos on her Instagram story of an injury she obtained in the kitchen. The first picture showed an up-close shot of her pointer fingers wrapped in a bunch of gauze. Her caption said, "see now...this is why I don't cook." She kept updating fans about the extent of her injury through Instagram; her next post was about her getting stitches. The star told fans, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Baby's first stitches lol back to never cooking again."</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Twitter Is Convinced That Zendaya Is Pregnant (& She Reacts)</a></span></p><p>Just last month Zendaya and her boyfriend Holland were seen at a restaurant where they indulged in a bunch of good foods, so it is pretty clear Zendaya is a food lover. She just may not be great at the cooking part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately for Zendaya she didn't have to go to the hospital and experience her first stitches alone. Alongside her was her assistant and good friend, Darnell Appling. She tagged him in her posts, and he even posted himself about the incident. He wrote, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Never a dull moment with Zendaya no pun intended."</a></p><p>So while fans might never see Zendaya in the kitchen again she's great at almost everything else besides cooking!</p><h2 id=zendaya-39-s-keeping-it-real-amid-a-blossoming-career>Zendaya's Keeping It Real Amid A Blossoming Career</h2><p>Zendaya has had a wonderful career already; her outstanding performance as Rue in Euphoria is always talked about, and she recently received a very deserving recognition for her acting. Zendaya has been nominated for four Emmy Awards. She has made history with these nominations by being the youngest lead actress and as a producing nominee, as an executive producer on Euphoria; the show is nominated for sixteen Emmys in total.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Even Zendaya Can't Help But To Laugh During These 'Euphoria' Outtakes</a></span></p><p>Fans were so excited to hear about the nominations and Zendaya also revealed how she felt about it. She said, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"The show obviously means so much to me and so much to everyone who makes it...I'm very, very proud."</a> She also stated that she is overwhelmed that it is just insane.</p><p>So maybe fans won't be seeing Zendaya back in her kitchen, ever again; but they can find their favorite star back on their screens soon doing what she does best. At least, after she's healed up from those stitches.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bsbEp5uasZFisLC7yqKloGWZo7e2vthmqq2hpJi1pr%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
