Simpson</a>'s name evokes a complex storm of fame, infamy, and the courtroom drama that shook the world.</p><p>Born on July 9th, 1947, in San Francisco, California, Simpson's journey from the football fields to the silver screen to the center of one of the most infamous criminal trials in history is nothing short of remarkable.</p><p>Orenthal James Simpson, known universally as "The Juice," first rose to stardom with his time in the national football league. A standout running back at the University of Southern California, he won the prestigious Heisman Trophy in 1968.</p><p>His NFL career with the Buffalo Bills and San Francisco 49ers was largely successful, with him breaking rushing records and entertaining fans with his electrifying speed and style.</p><p>Simpson's success transcended the football field. With his charisma and good looks, Hollywood beckoned, and he starred in films like the Naked Gun trilogy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simpson's life took a dark and irrevocable turn in 1994 when his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, were brutally murdered.</p><p>Simpson's subsequent criminal trial became one of the most sensationalized in history.</p><p>Though acquitted in the criminal case, a subsequent civil suit found him liable for the wrongful deaths, resulting in a $33.5 million judgment against him.</p><p>Since then, Simpson's public image has been synonymous with the case, overshadowing his prior achievements. After stints in film and a brief broadcasting career, his earning potential dwindled.</p><p>Simpson died of prostate cancer on April 10th, 2024, at the age of 76. During his 1992 divorce proceedings, Simpson stated his net worth was $10.8 million, marking his peak wealth.</p><p>For context, $10.8 million in 1992 would equate to $25 million today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Recent estimates of Simpson's net worth hover around $3 million, but this figure tells only a fraction of the story.</p><p>To understand the complexities of his financial situation, we must examine the key factors that built, shaoed, and ultimately eroded his wealth.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:35</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/patrick-mahomes-net-worth-how-he_site.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Patrick Mahomes' Net Worth: How He Earns And Spends His Football Fortune</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The youngest QB in history to be voted Super Bowl MVP and league MVP, Patrick Mahomes' on-field skill is equaled only by his financial prowess.</span><h2 id=the-juice-39-s-nfl-career>The Juice's NFL Career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4.jpg><p>O.J. Simpson's professional football career began in 1969 when he was selected first overall by the Buffalo Bills.</p><p>He caused a stir right away by demanding the biggest contract in pro sports history at the time - a five-year contract worth $650,000.</p><p>This led to a tense negotiation with team owner Ralph Wilson, with Simpson even threatening to walk away and pursue acting. Eventually, Wilson relented, paving the way for Simpson's on-field dominance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simpson experienced initial struggles in his early years with the Bills; however, his breakthrough came in 1972 when he surpassed the 1,000-yard rushing mark for the first time in his pro career.</p><p>The following year, Simpson became the first player to break the highly coveted 2,000-yard rushing mark, with 2,003 total rushing yards and 12 touchdowns. For his performance, Simpson won that year's NFL MVP Award and the Bert Bell Award.</p><p>Simpson also made his first and only playoff appearance during the 1974 season. Simpson's dominance continued in 1975, as he clinched the rushing title once again with an impressive 1,817 yards and 16 touchdowns.</p><p>Unfortunately, injuries hampered his 1977 season. Looking for a fresh start, Simpson was traded to the San Francisco 49ers before the 1978 season.</p><p>He played two seasons there before hanging up his cleats after a December 1979 game against the Atlanta Falcons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, his final play was a clutch 10-yard run on 3rd and 10 that secured a first down for his team. Simpson's impact on the NFL went far beyond his rushing yards.</p><p>He earned a spot in the prestigious Pro Bowl six times and received the ultimate recognition in 1985 with his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</p><p>Even decades later, his legacy as a dominant running back remains strong, as evidenced by his selection to the National Football League 100th Anniversary All-Time Team in 2019.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/aaron-rodgers-net-worth-2024.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Aaron Rodgers' Net Worth: How He Earns And Spends His Football Fortune</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Aaron Rodgers' net worth is staggeringly high.
