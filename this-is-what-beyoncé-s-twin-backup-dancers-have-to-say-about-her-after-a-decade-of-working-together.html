Thanks to the tour, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyoncé’s pulled in close to $600 million</a>. The world tour is the ninth for the “Break My Soul” singer in support of her seventh album, Renaissance (2022).</p><p>People loved seeing Beyoncé on tour and seeing her perform her <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> live; <a href=#>even celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Timothee Chalamet, and more were not missing out on the concerts</a>. And the fact that <a href=#>Blue Ivy got to perform with Beyoncé on stage</a> was another highlight for fans. However, certain dancers caught the eyes of the public. The Les Twins are French professional dancers who served as the right and left wings of Queen B. The Les Twins proved they were the right wingmen throughout the tour, but they've been by Beyoncé's side for years already.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beyonc-eacute-has-worked-with-the-les-twins-for-over-ten-years>Beyoncé Has Worked With The Les Twins For Over Ten Years</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/les-twins.jpg><p>Les Twins, Laurent and Larry Nicolas Bourgeois are French dancers and choreographers first known for appearing in French TV competitions. But they gained international popularity when their dance video from the World of Dance went viral in 2010. This led to performance on several TV shows, including the Ellen DeGeneres Show that same year.</p><p>In 2011, the Les Twins performed alongside Beyoncé at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards for the rest time. Following this, they performed with Beyoncé when she promoted the 4 album at award shows. The Les Twins went on to be expected fixtures on stage with Beyoncé.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their first tour together was On The Run Tour with Beyoncé and Jay-Z in 2014. They were also part of the dance crew for the Formation Tour in 2017. The Renaissance World Tour would be the third time the dynamic twins worked with Beyoncé.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/What-It-Is-Really-Like-Working-With-Beyonce-In-The-Studio-.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Beyoncé's Alleged 'Worst Song' Got Mixed Reactions From Her Fanbase</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>When this Beyonće song was named as the worst song, fans didn't agree.</span><h2 id=the-les-twins-watch-beyonc-eacute-rsquo-s-back-on-stage>The Les Twins Watch Beyoncé’s Back On Stage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/beyonc-and-les-twins.jpg><p>The Les Twins appeared on all 56 shows across 39 cities with Beyoncé for her Renaissance tour. The duo with the “Energy” singer had a good time. However, fans who attended the concerts noticed that the identical twins always had Beyoncé’s back while she performed.</p><p>During the first set of shows, <a href=#>one of the twins saved Beyoncé from an embarrassing wardrobe mishap in the middle of a live performance</a>. In a concert in Germany, the singer performed “Break My Soul” in a pink outfit, and her dress was about to slip, revealing all her cleavage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the twins saw it coming, strategically danced toward Beyoncé, and guided her hands to cover and fix the malfunction before it happened. This all happened without them breaking the beat.</p><p>There was another incident where the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Les Twins were ready to fight when a concert-goer threw an object at Beyoncé</a> while she performed on stage. This is just one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several instances where musicians were thrown things at while performing on stage</a>. One of the twins threw the sweatshirt back at the fan and told them off, ready to fight for Beyoncé.</p><p>The Les Twins are also Beyoncé’s cheerleaders. During the mute challenge when singing "Energy," the twins raise the hype when it’s time to cheer. And when the crowd doesn’t cheer loud enough, they show their disappointment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are several other instances during the Renaissance World Tour that showed the Les Twins were really Beyoncé’s wingmen, and she showed it.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kim-kardashian-s-parenting-is-questioned-as-she-sparkles-in-silver-with-daughter-north-west-at-beyonce-s-concert.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kim Kardashian’s Parenting Is Questioned As She Sparkles In Silver With Daughter North West At Beyonce’s Concert</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Kim wore matching outfits with her family and seemed unbothered by recent criticism at Queen Bey's concert.</span><h2 id=the-les-twins-love-beyonc-eacute>The Les Twins Love Beyoncé</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/beyonc-and-les-twins-renaissance-world-tour.jpg><p>As they moved from city to city, the Les Twins and Beyoncé team were in sync with their choreographies and stage presence. This sync may be because the duo and Beyoncé go way back in their collaborations on stage.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clips from the concert</a> also show Beyoncé comfortable around the twins. She wasn’t fazed when one of the twins poked her on her arm while she sat down on the twin during her performance.</p><p>Beyoncé has also been seen calling the twins her ride-or-die days after they blocked a fan from throwing an object at her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans have also noticed the interactions between Beyoncé and the Les Twins. The interactions made fans appreciate the devotion the dancers showed Queen B.</p><p>Some fans say Beyoncé needs to adopt the twins into her family. Others say they are the best thing besides Beyoncé that happened during the Renaissance World Tour.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Both Beyoncé And Taylor Swift Went On Tour, But Whose Is Bigger?</a></span></p><p>They have been called world-class, showing professionalism and dedication to their craft.</p><p>"So much respect for this dancer. He cared about Beyoncé and fixed the situation. He was just not a dancer, but a special person," a fan commented under the video where one of the twins helped Beyoncé with a wardrobe mishap.</p><p>The positive love the fans are also showing the Les Twins from the tour has increased their popularity, making them one of the best takeaways from the Renaissance World Tour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On why they showed devotion to Queen B, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">twins revealed what drew them to always work with Beyoncé</a>.</p><p>"The only reason why we stay with Beyoncé is that she is a monster [on stage]. She is the only one who can literally battle us on stage. Not everyone can battle us on stage."</p><p>And it showed throughout the Renaissance World tour that the three had a perfect synergy and energy to carry most of the shows. The Les Twins and Beyoncé make a dynamic team, and it is no wonder they are very much appreciated by Beyoncé.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmecGesKimk5p6tcPIp2SdmZ6YsrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
