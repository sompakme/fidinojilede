The show has been praised for its stunning locations, beautiful yachts, and of course, the drama that unfolds between the crew members.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Below Deck Adventure Bombed With Fans Who Are Addicted To The Bravo Franchise, Here’s Why</a></span></p><p>Camille Lamb and Ben Willoughby are both former cast members of Below Deck. They dated for a decent amount of time, but now things are unfortunately over. Here's everything to know about their relationship, and how things went crashing down.</p><h2 id=a-timeline-of-camille-lamb-and-ben-willoughby-39-s-relationship-on-below-deck>A Timeline Of Camille Lamb And Ben Willoughby's Relationship On Below Deck</h2><p>Fans are often drawn to reality TV because they enjoy the drama and relate to difficult decision-making, and find the obstacles contestants face to be identical to the ones they face in their own lives.</p><p>Below Deck is certainly filled with drama, even if it doesn't have as much as other big reality shows. <a href=#>Captain Lee having to leave the show</a> is just one example of this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The theme of self-interest vs. self-sacrifice runs through many reality shows. This plays into what made Lamb and Willoughby's relationship so interesting and entertaining, and why some fans are devastated after their break-up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/camille-lamb-ben-willoughby-below-deck.jpg><p>Lamb and Willoughby’s relationship played out in Below Deck season 10 after the latter joined as a deckhand. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to an interview Willoughby did with Screen Rant</a>, he became "smitten" by her captivating presence and they slowly fell in love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After that, things went pretty well for them on Below Deck. They were often seen having fun together on the show, and pretty much all pictures of them on social media included the pair of them smiling. This seemed like a magical romance that wouldn't end prematurely - however, there wasn't a happy-ever-after like fans believed there would be.</p><h2 id=why-did-camille-lamb-and-ben-willoughby-from-below-deck-break-up>Why Did Camille Lamb And Ben Willoughby From Below Deck Break Up?</h2><p>During the airing of Below Deck, Lamb and Willoughby shared many photos of themselves together on social media. This is where things also officially ended, as in a joint statement on Instagram earlier this year, Willoughby revealed that their romance was over. This is where things get truly messy.</p><p>People break up for many reasons. Some of the most common reasons include lack of communication, infidelity, and differences in values or goals. However, every relationship is unique and there are many other reasons why people break up. Willoughby and Lamb definitely fit in that "other" category of break-up reasons.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Was Camille Lamb's Below Deck Salary Worth The Endless Drama She Endured On The Show?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to an interview Lamb did with Dexerto</a>, after her time on the show was over, she was an anxious wreck. Lamb confessed that she had to be medicated because of how bad the situation and her mental health had deteriorated. She admitted she didn't treat Willoughby "fairly", either, which made things between them even more stressful.</p><p>According to People, Lamb had also been seen talking back to her superiors, cursing out fellow crew members and dangerously leaving shards of broken glass in the trash. After a brief grace period when she stepped up her game for a few days, Lamb got into a screaming match with a co-star in front of several charter guests. All of this plays into why Lamb and Willoughby didn't work out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/camille-lamb-below-deck-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back to Willoughby's interview with Screen Rant, he acknowledged his remaining affection for Lamb was genuine, causing him to act irrationally with his rebound girlfriend Leigh-Ann Smith. According to Cheat Sheet, many people around the show confirmed that Willoughby and fellow co-star Smith dated, and more things were confirmed after season 10 aired.</p><p>Rebound relationships aren't a rare thing, either. <a href=#>Even someone as famous as Ben Stiller was a rebound relationship</a> at one point in time. In today's culture, rebound flings are somewhat common.</p><p>According to Bravo, after Willoughby and Lamb broke up, Willoughby rented an apartment with Smith. They lived together for a month and Leigh-Ann was there for him as he was getting through his breakup. It's unconfirmed if their relationship is that serious, or if it ever was. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Willoughby recently confirmed he didn't ghost Smith</a>, although things between them don't appear to be fantastic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Willoughby's feelings for Lamb still seem to affect the man. Both Lamb and Willoughby have inferred that much in their interviews. But does Lamb have any remaining feelings for Willoughby?</p><h2 id=will-camille-lamb-and-ben-willoughby-ever-get-back-together>Will Camille Lamb And Ben Willoughby Ever Get Back Together?</h2><p>Getting back together with an ex is a complicated process that depends on many factors. Some of the reasons why exes get back together include unresolved feelings, nostalgic memories, and the need to give the relationship another chance.</p><p>However, there are also many reasons why exes don’t get back together, such as trust issues, incompatible goals or values, and the inability to forgive past mistakes. Those reasons make this situation fascinating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/below-deck-camille-lamb-alissa-humber.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s important to remember that every relationship is unique and there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. If Willoughby and Smith are considering getting back together with each other, it’s important they take the time to reflect on why they broke up in the first place.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Below Deck's Kate Chastain Returned To Reality TV And She's Not A Team Player Anymore</a></span></p><p>While it's still not known how much of a role Smith's mental well-being played into their separation from each other, it's the only factor either of them has mentioned when discussing the relationship's ending and its aftermath. Lamb seems to be in a better place now, and she even told Dexerto that she wants to join Love Island.</p><p>According to Deadline, season 10 of Below Deck will return later this year. It doesn't seem that Lamb will be returning, and Willoughby isn't confirmed to come back either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiamqWZobmmecuapJtlkpq7bsPIpaOorZedr7q%2FjKucpZmknryvv8eip2aaopqurHnUqWSwoJGpeqmtz6mcp52UYq%2BmwNaenKdlpJ2ybq7EpaawZZSasKx50q2Yq6tf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
