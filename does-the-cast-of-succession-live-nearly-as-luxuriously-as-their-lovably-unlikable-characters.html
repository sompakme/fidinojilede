It's hardly surprising that Cox is one of just three stars on the show to have a net worth of more than $10 million; he's been making money from his talents for quite some time. Cox's acting career began in earnest in the '70s.</p><p>Cox, 73, appeared as Lauren Laverne's guest on a Sunday morning episode of BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, where he admitted that he owns more clothing items than his actor wife Nicole Ansari.</p><p>“I am a bit of a hoarder. I have a thing about clothes,” he tells Laverne, choosing a sewing kit as his luxury item for his imaginary island stay. “It is one of those things you are left with, an insecurity. It has to come out somewhere.”</p><p>The actor has a strong belief in frugality as a result of traumatic experiences in his formative years. When Cox was eight years old, his father passed away, and his mother later suffered from serious mental illness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor claims that his early experiences with poverty have made him "cautious" with money in his adult life, "I can be a bit parsimonious at times."</p><h2 id=alan-ruck-uses-his-extravagant-wealth-to-protect-his-health><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Alan Ruck Uses His Extravagant Wealth To Protect His Health</span></h2><p>It's hard to think that the actor who broke out as Ferris Bueller's best buddy in 1986 is now one of the wealthiest actors on television's highest-rated drama in the year 2023. In fact, certain experiences on the show <a href=#>attributed to the most “exhilarating” parts of his career</a>.</p><p>Alan Ruck has been working consistently for decades, and his role as Connor Roy, the eldest Roy son but the one least invested in the business, has brought him massive paychecks.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Brian Cox And Alan Ruck Play Father And Son In Succession, But What's The Age Difference Between Them In Real Life?</a></span></p><p>Ruck has a net worth of $12 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. The actor seems to be rapidly ascending the Hollywood star ladder. However, the actor has long claimed that his alcoholism has held back his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ruck told Insider that he's trying to cut down on his drinking and live a healthier lifestyle now that he has so many responsibilities, especially after his huge role in Succession.</p><p>"Well, I used to drink a lot," Ruck said. "I don't do that anymore. There was always an excuse to take a drink. If things were not going well, I would have a drink. If things were going exceedingly well, I'd have many drinks."</p><p>Besides, Ruck is done looking for a good time. He has found it in the award-winning HBO series Succession.</p><h2 id=jeremy-strong-uses-his-impressive-net-worth-to-support-his-family><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jeremy Strong Uses His Impressive Net Worth To Support His Family</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/8-1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kendall, played by Jeremy Strong, is the most ruthlessly ambitious of the Roy children. Strong has emerged as the film's breakout star, easily winning over critics and audiences alike (not to mention amassing a fortune).</p><p>In 2020, Strong won the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of the middle child in a family of three. He made $3 million for the third season, or $300,000 to $350,000 every episode. His current net worth, as reported by Celebrity Net Worth, is $4 million, so this is a nice boost.</p><p>According to an interview he gave to GQ, Strong is committed to providing for his family. He has three daughters with his wife, a documentary filmmaker and child psychiatrist, Emma Wall. They now have three children, aged four, two, and one, all of whom were born during his time spent on Succession.</p><p>He has an Emmy and the luxury of choice when it comes to acting and being a family man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-macfadyen-uses-his-succession-fame-to-make-even-more-money><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Matthew Macfadyen Uses His Succession Fame To Make Even More Money</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/matthew-macfadyen.png><p>Playing Tom Wambsgans, who marries into the Roy family, brings in a nice salary for actor Matthew Macfayden. Macfayden's most notable roles before Succession were as Mr. Darcy in the 2005 Pride and Prejudice adaption, as well as in Death at a Funeral and The Three Musketeers.</p><p>The Emmy winner has a net worth of $5 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. It has been stated that his income grew from $100,000 to $350,000 each episode during the course of the show's third season.</p><p>You might think that Macfadyen would prefer to appear in a role where rivals don't swap harsh remarks. Nonetheless, he'll be making his post-show debut in the cast of Deadpool 3.The embarrassing irony?

It’s ass-paralyzingly boring, just acting like tennis balls and dots on the screen. You’re doing it for the money.”</p><p>Alas, Macfadyen is now, as he predicted, doing it for the money.</p><h2 id=kieran-culkin-is-frugal-with-money-even-with-his-outrageous-salary><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kieran Culkin Is Frugal With Money Even With His Outrageous Salary</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kieran-culkin.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kieran Culkin spent almost a decade trying to find his own identity after living in the shadow of his famous older brother Macaulay. Kieran followed in his famous sibling's footsteps by pursuing a career in acting. While he did find some work, his breakthrough came with Succession, his first truly significant project.</p><p>Before his breakout role in Succession, Culkin had mostly appeared in supporting or cameo capacities in independent films. His performance in the low-budget film Igby Goes Down won him a Golden Globe nomination, but it didn't lead to a huge paycheck for him.</p><p>Now, he earns at least $300,000 every episode, or about $3 million for the third season, much like his cast members. According to CelebrityNetWorth, he is worth $5 million.</p><p>To Insider, he joked, "I'm finally making money for the first time in my 30-something-year career," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">referring to the meteoric rise of the Emmy-winning show's viewership</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though he has a lot of money now, Culkin still likes to live frugally so that he can keep exploring the ever-shifting world of acting.

About five years ago, she began making appearances in American television and cinema. Since then, her career has been on the rise, and Succession is just the latest huge part to bring her fame, fortune, and critical acclaim.</p><p>Snook's wealth is estimated to be $4 million. It's safe to assume that her Season 4 remuneration is at least as high as her $300,000–$350,000 per episode average from Season 3.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Was Sarah Snook Before Becoming Shiv Roy In 'Succession'?</a></span></p><p>Snook isn't shy about flaunting her extravagant spending, having just dropped $1.83 million on a two-bedroom Williamsburg apartment in Brooklyn, New York, while the rest of the group is notoriously tight-lipped about their personal finances.</p><p>Snook may be happy in her new north Brooklyn apartment, but her TV persona would not be.</p><h2 id=nicholas-braun-bought-a-stunning-condo-in-the-lower-east-side><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Nicholas Braun Bought A Stunning Condo In The Lower East Side</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/nicholas-braun.png><p>Nicholas Braun, better known as cousin Greg these days, was less well-known than many of his co-stars prior to the release of Succession.

Even though Braun isn't a Roy child, he seems to be making about $300,000 per episode, which is on par with the salaries of co-stars Strong, Snook, Culkin, and Ruck.</p><p>Braun recently spent $1.9 million on a one-bedroom apartment in the Bowery neighborhood of Manhattan. The previous asking price was $2 million. The spacious 1,000 square feet unit accommodates a modernized one-bedroom, one-bathroom layout.</p><p>We could say that the salary for playing "crazy cousin Greg" on HBO is through the roof.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dqbWmecKaqq1ln5t6tMHCnJysq5mku26%2Fz56lnatdqbWmtdFmnKenoqK8tr%2BMrJilmaKufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
