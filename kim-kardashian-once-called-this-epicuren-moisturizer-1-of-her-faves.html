A-list influence plays a big role in our shopping experience, so we’re going to remember when someone like <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> professes her love for a <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">specific moisturizer</a>, even when years have passed since.</p><p>When it comes to body products, we heavily trust in Kardashian. She has access to just about any beauty product on the planet, so we know what she chooses to use is going to be out of this world. The reality star has been very open about her experience with psoriasis, so we know her favorite products are going to be ultra-kind to skin. Her clear, glowy complexion proves it!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Epicuren Discovery Kukui Coconut After Bath Moisturizer</a> for just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$46</a> at Amazon!
