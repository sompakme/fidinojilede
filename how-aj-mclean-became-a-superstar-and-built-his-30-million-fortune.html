Born on January 9, 1978, in West Palm Beach, AJ McLean was raised by <a href=#>his mother and grandparents</a> as his parents went their separate ways when he was just two years old. Despite growing up without his father, the two reunited in 1997 and have since been in regular contact.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McLean's DNA test results read like a geography quiz. He has Iberian, Central American, South American, North, West, and East European, North African, Nigerian, Ashkenazi Jewish, and <a href=#>Middle Eastern roots</a>. When it comes to relationships, AJ had his fair share of romantic escapades. Luckily, he found love with model and makeup artist Rochelle Deanna Karidis, who he credits with helping him overcome his drug addiction. The duo got married in 2011, and have two daughters together.</p><p>In 2023, reports surfaced that the couple was separating, but we wish them both the best.

As a child, McLean had a speech impediment that gave him a lisp and a tendency to stutter. However, this did not stop him from pursuing his passion for performing. With his mother's encouragement, he started dancing lessons at the age of four, studying everything from ballet to ballroom, tap to Hip Hop. The rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>McLean joined the Backstreet Boys, becoming their member at the age of 14, despite the group's original age range of 16 to 19. The rest of the band, including Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, Kevin Richardson, and Kevin's cousin Brian Littrell, were all in their late teens or early twenties. Regardless of his age, McLean contributed to <a href=#>the band's success</a> in the late '90s to early 2000s. The group has since celebrated its 20th anniversary and released a new album, In a World Like This, in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McLean also explored solo ventures, creating a character named Johnny No Name, who he used as his alter ego. His solo project, Johnny No Name, which featured <a href=#>rap and rock music</a>, was released in 2000.&nbsp;He&nbsp;is living proof that you can achieve great success by staying true to yourself and pursuing your dreams. His net worth is estimated at around $30 million and he has used his success to give back to the community through charity work.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Here's How Kelsea Ballerini Became A Country Music Star" href=#>Here's How Kelsea Ballerini Became A Country Music Star</a></span></p><h2 id=aj-s-rewarding-stints-in-film-and-television>AJ’s Rewarding Stints in Film and Television</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From Nickelodeon Guts to The Bravest Knight, AJ McLean has had some rewarding stints in film and television.
