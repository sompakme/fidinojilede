He was also a judge on a reality TV show ‘Nashville Star’ on USA Networks for one year. His contribution to the country music revolutionized Texas music.</p><h2>Early life and music</h2><p>Robinson was born on September 1, 1964, in Houston, Texas. But he was raised in Bandera, Texas. He loved his hometown, where he played football. His football career came to an end as a result of an injury. When one door closes, another opens. He moved to Austin and began his country music career with his 1996 album ‘Bandera’, named after his hometown.</p><p>Two years later, in 1998, he released another album ‘Life of the Party’ under the record label Sony’s Subsidiary ‘Luck Dog Records.’ It had many songs that resonated with the audience.

He released his final album in 2013 ‘High Life’. He retired from singing after a surgical procedure was done on his throat, limiting him from ever singing again.</p><p>He announced his retirement with a note that said,</p><p>“With a very heavy heart, I am officially retiring from the stage and studio,” he continues. “It’s been an amazing ride, and I cannot tell you all what the last 25 years has meant to me. I was looking forward to another 25, but as they say ‘shit happens.”</p><p>‘Life of The Party’ is considered a standard album for the country music artist. He combined his love for his hometown and country music with grittiness, southern Hard Rock, and ingenuity, transformed the genre, and paved the path for modern country music.</p><h2>Personal life</h2><p>In 1998, Cahrlie Robinson married Emily Erwin, now known as Strayer, who founded the band ‘Chicks.’ According to a newspaper, their love inspired the ‘Chicks’ song ‘Cowboy Take Me Away’. Together they had three children. They parted ways in 2008 and got divorced due to unknown reasons.</p><p>He remarried and tied the knot with Kristen Robinson.
