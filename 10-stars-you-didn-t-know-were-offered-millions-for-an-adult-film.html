Some actors even attempt to get their start in adult films, believing that a “legit” director will one day see their work and select them to work on a major movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the adult entertainment is pretty much frowned upon if you want to be taken seriously as an actor (or any kind of respectable celebrity), there’s certainly money in it. When people are asked to star in adult films, the contract often comes with lots of zeros, in order to make the deal appealing. Some celebrities have decided to go through with it because they needed the money (and hoped no one they knew would see the “movie”). Some people know their fame will only last a few minutes, and they decide to maximize it with an adult film appearance or two. Others turned down the offers because things haven’t gotten that bad for them financially. Of course, executives in the adult film industry often ask celebrities who are currently popular to star in their movies to boost the popularity of the industry. In these cases, the answer is usually "no".&nbsp;Here are 10 people you probably didn’t know were offered millions to star in adult films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christine-ouzounian>10. Christine Ouzounian</h2><p>Christine Ouzounian used to be <a href=#>Ben Affleck’s</a> nanny, and she allegedly has a lot to do with why Ben and his soon to be ex-wife actress <a href=#>Jennifer Garner</a>, are no longer together. Chances are she won’t be getting a job taking care of children again any time soon (most wives aren’t going to hire her after her affiliation with the whole Ben and Jen thing), so why not check out adult films, right? Seems like a suitable career transition. P**n director Alex Braun offered Christine $1 million to star in an adult film parody series of Batman vs Superman. Ouzounian will reportedly be offered the role of Batwoman, but there’s no word on whether she’s accepted.</p><p></p><h2 id=ray-j>9. Ray J</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We’re guessing the actor, singer and younger brother of superstar <a href=#>Brandy</a>, wanted to be seen as an adult, which was the motivation behind his sex tape with then-girlfriend <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>. Obviously the tape did really well (it made over $50 million), and honestly, it helped to keep them both in the spotlight (although clearly Kim is more famous). After the “success” of <a href=#>Ray J’s</a> sex tape, Vivid Entertainment offered him a four-movie deal. Ray J turned it down, probably because his parents and sister informed him that he’d embarrassed the family enough. He decided to go with a VH1 deal instead, and that’s how <i>For The Love of Ray J</i> was born.</p><p></p><h2 id=ashley-dupre>8. Ashley Dupre</h2><p>After it was revealed that <a href=#>Ashley Dupre</a> was <a href=#>Eliot Spitzer’s</a> favorite call-girl, she became pretty famous. She did a series of interviews on notable news shows, talking about how she came to know the politician and what her plans were for the future. Of course, Vivid Entertainment became pretty interested in Dupre, and offered her a pretty sweet deal—a deal that would make her the highest paid actress in the p**n industry. These days, she’s left her work as a call girl behind, and has turned into a bit of a New York socialite. She’s been seen at high-end fashion shows, and was hanging out with <a href=#>Heidi Montag</a>, so maybe a (somewhat) legit Hollywood career is in her future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=spencer-pratt>7. Spencer Pratt</h2><p><a href=#>Spencer Pratt</a> is best known for being Heidi Montag’s boyfriend on the MTV reality show <i>The Hills</i>. Even though Heidi and Spencer had their ups and downs, they ended up getting married and even appeared on a season of <i>Marriage Boot Camp</i>. The Pratts also had some financial hardships after leaving <i>The Hills</i>, and Heidi ended up getting a series of plastic surgeries in hopes of establishing a movie career. Instead, her husband got a movie offer. Well, an adult movie offer. Michael Lucas made Spencer an offer and stated that the company would “do anything” to make Spencer Pratt the next focus of one of their all-male films. Even though the money was allegedly pretty great, Pratt turned the offer down.</p><p></p><h2 id=britney-spears>6. Britney Spears</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Britney Spears</a> has definitely come a long way since her days on the Mickey Mouse Club. When she hit the music scene in 1999 with her single <i>Baby One More Time</i>, it was pretty clear she’d be in the business for quite some time. Of course, Spears has also had her share of ups and downs in the business, including a failed relationship with fellow singer <a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a>, a nervous breakdown, and a marriage to (and divorce from) dancer <a href=#>Kevin Federline</a>, with whom she has two children. David Hans Schmidt&nbsp;allegedly offered to pay Spears $100 million for a sex tape that featured her and her then-husband. He stated that the offer depended on whether the Spears-Federline tape was any good. Luckily, Spears’ publicity team (and her family) made sure she didn’t take the deal, and she’s currently headlining in Vegas, which is a much better professional choice.</p><p></p><h2 id=amber-portwood>5. Amber Portwood</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Amber Portwood</a> is known for starring in the MTV reality show Teen Mom. She had a daughter named Leah with her then-fiance, Gary. Amber clearly loved her little girl, but she and Gary had too many issues in their relationship to go any further. Amber was also arrested and spent time behind bars for assaulting Gary. She dealt with her substance abuse issues while incarcerated, and even became a mentor to other young women. She was also offered a pretty tempting offer do star in adult&nbsp;movies, but turned it down because she wanted to be a good example for Leah. While she hasn’t exactly shown her daughter the best way to control her temper, she definitely made the right decision by saying no to this offer.</p><p></p><h2 id=tara-reid>4. Tara Reid</h2><p><a href=#>Tara Reid</a> was the queen of hotties in the early 2000s, and even solidified her celebrity status with a relationship with <a href=#>Carson Daly</a>. When Reid posted a pretty racy picture on social media, adult entertainment&nbsp;companies reached out to her and stated that she could show off her “beauty and talent by having sex on camera.” She was offered a million dollars for the deal, but turned it down via social media, stating that she does “movies, not p**n.” Tara Reid was getting a lot of criticism for losing so much weight recently, so the <i>Sharknado</i> star likely posted pictures of her in a bikini to show that she’s getting her body back on track and doesn’t want to be accused of having an eating disorder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=justin-bieber>3. Justin Bieber</h2><p>It’s hard to believe that just a few years ago, <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> was a cute little kid with a great voice and a talent for playing musical instruments, getting lots of attention on YouTube. Since Bieber was discovered, he’s tried pretty hard to turn himself into a bad boy. He got lots of tattoos and even got involved in a standard scandal that involved a woman claiming Justin was the father of her child. According to VH1, Justin Bieber was also offered $1 million to star in adult films. While this would definitely change his image, it’s not the best career move. He should probably just stick to posting shirtless selfies on Instagram.</p><p></p><h2 id=miley-cyrus>2. Miley Cyrus</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once upon a time, the thing <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> was most famous for was starring as Hannah Montana on the Disney Channel with her dad, country singer <a href=#>Billy Ray Cyrus</a>. These days, GameLink, an adult film website that sells movies and products, is offering Cyrus $1 million to show the world that “she’s not a little girl anymore.” Miley seems to want everyone to talk about her, and this would definitely do the trick. There’s no word on whether the singer and actress has accepted the deal, but it’s probably best to just allow the offer to be another part of the celebrity buzz that boosts her career.</p><p></p><h2 id=kylie-jenner>1. Kylie Jenner</h2><p>That’s right. The youngest member of the Kardashian clan, who recently turned 18, is getting lots of offers to star in adult films. Vivid Entertainment&nbsp;offered Jenner $10 million if she’d star in a film with her boyfriend, rapper <a href=#>Tyga</a>. The head honcho over at Vivid, Steve Hirsch, stated in the letter to Kylie that a sex tape helped to launch Kim’s career, and would probably have a similar benefit for her. Kylie is also reportedly getting offers from Digital Playground, who wants her to be their brand ambassador. Hopefully, Jenner will focus on being a reality star and consider something unconventional, like going to college.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>nydailynews.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>tmz.com</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#>vh1.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>wetpaint.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2owaK%2B0mawqK1dmbalutNmoqenp2LEpr7EZqafnpWnsqV5zKKjpaGfo8Buss6rZJqmXZaxtrjTZp2ipJ1k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
