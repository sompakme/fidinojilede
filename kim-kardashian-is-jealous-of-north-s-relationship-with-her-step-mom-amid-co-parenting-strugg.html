She’s also been bothered by the fact that Bianca looks so much like her, physically and style-wise. “This woman has done stuff to make herself look like Kim,” the source noted.</p><p>Apparently, Kim’s envy is making co-parenting difficult with Kanye. “It’s already a nightmare co-parenting with [Kanye]; this is just another wrench," they added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-had-strict-rules-for-bianca-when-she-first-met-her-and-kanye-rsquo-s-kids>Kim Had Strict Rules For Bianca When She First Met Her And Kanye’s Kids</h2><p>Kim and Kanye married in 2014 and welcomed four children during their relationship. But they finalized their divorce last year after Kim had filed over a year before.</p><p>It was only weeks after the divorce was made official that Kanye reportedly married Bianca in a non-legally recognized ceremony. The public wasn’t even aware the two were dating. Rumors suggested <a href=#>Kanye’s religious beliefs contributed to their quick union</a>.</p><p>The timeline didn’t seem to leave Kim a lot of time to adjust to the idea of her kids having a step-mother. It’s not even clear if Bianca met Kanye’s kids before their wedding. But soon after, she was photographed spending time with his children on multiple occasions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Pete Davidson May Have Wanted To Marry Kim Kardashian, Even With Kanye's Drama</a></span></p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was reported that <a href=#>Kim had strict rules for Bianca</a> when she first started spending time with her kids.</p><p>“She's sent a message through her team to Kanye's team, basically saying congratulations, and given that it looks like Bianca may soon become a step-mom to the kids, she would like to have a sit down to get to know her in a private meeting," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source said in January</a>.</p><p>The insider also added that Kim has done a background check on Bianca, saying, “She already has started to vet her, which is standard for anyone that comes into contact with her children and will have access to them.”</p><p>Though Kanye has admitted Kim has the kids 80% of the time, she likely couldn’t control if they spend time with Bianca when in their dad’s care. But it appears she’s tried controlling the situation, and perhaps more so for her benefit than that of their kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bianca-knew-kanye-when-he-was-still-married-to-kim-kardashian>Bianca Knew Kanye When He Was Still Married To Kim Kardashian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kim_Kardashian_and_Kanye_West_at_the_Met_Gala_in_2019.png><p>Interestingly, Kim’s conflict with Bianca may have been brewing when she was still married to Kanye. Bianca was hired to work at Ye’s brand Yeezy in 2020, so she may have known him for a while before they got together.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One report from Page Six</a> claims that Kim has disliked Bianca for a while. “Sources say that it was well known around the Yeezy HQ that the boss’ wife didn’t like her, and suspected that his architectural designer wanted to do more than handle his erections,” the publication said.</p><p>“Kim hates her,” a source added to Page Six.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If the reports about Kim’s feelings towards Bianca are true, then it’s understandable why she’s having a difficult time co-parenting with Kanye.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmK2tHnJnpilp6WoerCyjKemq6yYqHqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMsKCtoF2dsrN50q2cqWWdpLpurcyim2abn2K9or7Ep6uippdiwLW%2B1KCepZ2jYsSqwMdmopqmqZp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
