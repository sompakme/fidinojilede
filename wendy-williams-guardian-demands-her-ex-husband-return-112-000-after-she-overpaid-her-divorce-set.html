While there have been rumors of financial abuse, as the television personality previously accused her manager as well as bank of withholding funds, her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">guardian is now accusing Wendy’s ex-husband</a> of taking advantage of her financially.</p><p>Sabrina Morrissey, Williams' guardian, is allegedly pursuing a sum of $112,500 from Kevin Hunter, the talk show host's former spouse, asserting that he received an excess amount in divorce settlements.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Wendy-Williams-Ex-Kevin-Hunter-Sues-Her-Talkshow-For-Wrongful-Termination.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Wendy Williams' Ex-Husband Kevin Hunter Sues Her Talkshow For Wrongful Termination</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Less than a month after The Wendy Williams Show was cancelled, Kevin Hunter is hoping for a million dollar payout over his 2019 firing.</span><p>Hunter, who had previously filed a petition in court due to cessation of payments agreed upon in the divorce, claims to have stopped receiving payments in 2021.</p><p>However, Morrissey contended that as per the terms of the settlement agreement, the severance payments were to cease if Williams' annual earnings fell below a specified threshold, which they did in in October 2021 following her departure from hosting The Wendy Williams Show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/screenshot-2024-03-14-at-8-43-03-am.png> Wendy Williams&nbsp;<p>"She continued to pay Mr. Hunter. He says in his motion papers… that he was paid through January of 2022," Morrissey wrote in her court filing. "As a result, [Kevin] has been unjustly enriched by the receipt of $112,500 ($37,500 x 3 months) belonging to [Wendy]."</p><p>In 2022, Williams was placed under court-ordered guardianship, entrusting Morrissey with the management of her financial affairs and she’s since largely stepped away from the spotlight, except for a documentary released this year that explored what happened to Williams, going into detail about her newly publicized health condition.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Morrissey’s filing ends with a request for the return of the funds to Wendy, simultaneously proposing a gag order to restrict her ex-husband from publicly speaking on the issue. Additionally, she advocated for the dismissal of Hunter's plea to reopen the case in court, proposing arbitration as an alternative resolution method.</p><p>In response, Hunter continues to argue for the resumption of payments, insisting on the disclosure of Wendy's financial records spanning from their divorce proceedings to the present to prove his point. The case remains ongoing.</p><p>Unfortunately, this isn’t the only financial problem Williams is dealing with. Last month, it was reported <a href=#>she owes over $560,000 in unpaid taxes</a> on her New York condo, which she originally bought for $4.5 million in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's been reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wendy William’s current net worth is $500,000</a>, a far cry from the $20 million she was estimated to have when at the height of her television year, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gave her a million-dollar annual salary</a> at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsJ2emcZuw8ilo6KZnah6qMHAq5uimZ5isaa5wKebrGWVrXqpwdKbmKecXaeytcHRp2RqaWJlfXF5zq%2Bcq6iRnrFusMivpqublWLApsDTpZymnZ6pfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
