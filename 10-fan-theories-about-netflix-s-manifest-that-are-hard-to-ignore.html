However, actor Matt Long who stars in the series as Zeke Landon, might not have the time to join the cast as a regular member for the 4th season.</p><p>We are many months away from the release of Netflix’s Manifest 4th season. However, fan theories are already spreading like fire, and people are speculating on what might the last season Manifest be hiding. You can explore below some of those expectations.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything 'The Circle' Season 3 Did Differently From The First Two</a></span></p><h2 id=angelina-will-have-an-even-darker-personality><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Angelina Will Have An Even Darker Personality</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Baby kidnapper and killer Angelina</a>, who first presented herself as a helpless and poor girl, will prove to be even more sinister in the 4th coming season of Manifest. As a reminder, Angelina set a fire by Eden and killed the baby’s mother, Grace. Angelina’s character will be sent from hell in the next Manifest season.</p><h2 id=the-major-might-be-michaela><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>The Major Might Be Michaela</span></h2><p>A mind-blowing fan theory circulating about Manifest’s 4th season is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Major General Katherine Fitz is the future Michaela</a>. Supporting reasons for that theory are first, that both Michaela and The Major wear the same accessories. And second, both of the characters share an interest in the “Callings.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michaela-and-zeke-might-breakup><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Michaela And Zeke Might Breakup</span></h2><p>Zeke’s super abilities helped him discover several truths, including that Jared is still not over his love for Michaela. He also knew that Michaela still holds feelings for Jared, which will further deteriorate their relationship. Fans are hoping the couple will not split up in season 4. Note that <a href=#>Zeke is played by actor Matt Long who is worth $2 Million</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Left Divided Over Netflix’s Britney Spears Documentary Teaser</a></span></p><h2 id=maybe-grace-will-resurrect><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Maybe Grace Will Resurrect</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Grace was killed in a stabbing by Angelina, some theorized that the mother may resurrect from death. Since it’s not something new to relive people from the dead in Manifest, the theories might be true. Creator of the series Jeff Rake said that Grace’s character will live through her children and husband, Ben.</p><h2 id=or-ben-will-eventually-get-into-a-relationship-with-saanvi><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Or Ben Will Eventually Get Into A Relationship With Saanvi</span></h2><p>After Angelina killed Ben’s wife, Grace, and kidnapped his daughter Eden, fans expect that the girl’s mother was dead forever. This increases the chance of Ben and Saanvi coming together to form a couple.</p><p>A Reddit user reinforced the theory mentioning that Saanvi revealed to the Major that she had a crush on Ben.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cal-stone-will-no-longer-have-a-death-rate><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Cal Stone Will No Longer Have A Death Rate</span></h2><p>Cal disappeared and then reappeared in season 3. Fans speculated that Cal will not have a death rate anymore since he returned as a teenager and grew in age. They also wonder if he has seen the future in those five years, because he was not surprised after his reappearance.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Fan Theories About Netflix's 'Outer Banks' Worth Considering</a></span></p><h2 id=the-return-of-daly><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Return Of Daly</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Captain Daly disappeared in season 3 with the 828 Plane. The same happened in the first season, where Daly also faded away as he stole a plane. Fans theorized that Daly wanted to mess with the process of the 828 flight and lost his memory for five and a half years. They expect him to reappear in season 4.</p><h2 id=grace-rsquo-s-sapphire-necklace-will-play-a-big-role><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Grace’s Sapphire Necklace Will Play A Big Role</span></h2><p>Grace didn’t wear her Bluestone Sapphire necklace in every episode and in every season for nothing. Fans think that Sapphire traces found by Saanvi on the plane’s tailfin, Ben’s hands, and the meth heads have a big-valued significance. Maybe the Sapphire necklace will bring Grace good luck and let her rise from the dead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tj-is-set-for-bad-surprises-when-he-returns><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>TJ Is Set For Bad Surprises When He Returns</span></h2><p>After TJ left for Egypt to find the mystery that should let him stay with Olive, the girl started dating a friend of Cal named Kevin. Fans expect that TJ will be back in season 4 just to be heartbroken. Discovering that the girl he sacrificed everything for has moved on with a new relationship will not be easy news for him.</p><h2 id=the-miracles-and-the-callings-are-all-connected><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Miracles And The Callings Are All Connected</span></h2><p>The line "It’s All Connected" was repeated over the last three seasons of the Netflix series Manifest. As a result, several fan theories spread and linked the miracles and callings together, from Al Zuras ship being connected to the plane to Zeke’s survival, saving Angelina, and Grace’s death. Those theories won’t be verified until the release of the 4th season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The 8 Most Interesting Fan Theories About Mean Girls' Regina George</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWWlrtuwMeepquhlah6oq7OrqtmppWps62116xkppmenrOmv9Nmq6GZpGKus7GMoZirnF2pvG61xqemq51f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
