  Insiders well-versed in the matter have informed the outlet that Rachel made over $350,000 for her participation in the show's 10th season. This impressive sum translates to nearly $20,000 per episode, encompassing a total of 19 episodes, clearly showcasing that it was far from an insignificant amount."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Ariana [Madix] is the hero. Tom is another character who doesn’t take the hit as much as you in this scandal of all.”</p><p>“But you’re right, the realm is making a lot of money and now it took three of you in a recipe to create the scandal,” the reality veteran went on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The former cast member of The Real Housewives of New York City holds the view that Leviss should have received a more substantial compensation, given her affair with Tom Sandoval, 41, which generated considerable media attention and led to increased ratings for the show.</p><p>“As people who are partially produced … Let’s just say that it’s real in a very unreal circumstance. So now you have one of the three characters that can’t even afford to pay for your treatment that you just went through,” Bethenny went on. “Because it’s my understanding that you get paid in a year less than my interns get paid.”</p><p>She was referring to alluding to Leviss' period at a mental health facility following the conclusion of Vanderpump’s 10th season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Frankel's comment took Leviss by surprise, but Leviss claimed that Bravo producers had actually encouraged her to bring drama on screen.</p><p>What’s clear, however, is the Vanderpump cast makes a significant income, given Raquel’s six figure income last season. It’s also been reported that some cast members, specifically Ariana, have seen an increase in their revenue from social media thank to the attention around Scandoval – Raquel and Tom’s infamous affair.</p><p>With ratings through the roof for the long-time reality show, it wouldn’t be surprising if the cast sees an increase in pay during the upcoming season.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: &nbsp;<a href=#>Ryan Gosling Got A Surprisingly Low Pay For ‘Barbie’ As It Makes A Billion At Box Office</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2For3UnqNmpJWrtrS%2FjKaYnZ1daIJxfI9pZJ%2BnomLDorrDnqmprZ2leqWx0qmgrZ1dl7K1tMSnpbJllqeur7fInmSsmameu6h50qGcrGWglralecueqqxlpJ2ur3nIp6ueqp6ofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
