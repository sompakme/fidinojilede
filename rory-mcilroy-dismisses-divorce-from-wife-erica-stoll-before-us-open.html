The pair tied the knot in April 2017 and share daughter Poppy, 3.</p><p>A source exclusively told Us that Stoll, 36, <a href=#>was “lonely” in their marriage</a>, which ultimately led to their “breaking point.” In addition, parenthood shifted Stoll’s priorities, and she was not unable to travel with McIlroy as much as she did previously.</p><p>“She knew what she was getting into with his profession, but once they had Poppy, things really changed and she had a new perspective,” the insider said. “Erica was usually absent for most of his tournaments and was really focused on Poppy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>McIlroy broke his silence about their uncoupling on May 14. “Rory McIlroy’s communications team confirmed today that a divorce has been filed,” a spokeswoman for McIlroy told The Irish Star. “They stressed Rory’s desire to ensure this difficult time is as respectful and amicable as possible. He will not be making any further comment.”</p><p>The couple first met in 2012 at the Ryder Cup, where Stoll had been working as a PGA transport official, but McIlroy was romantically involved with tennis player <strong>Caroline Wozniacki</strong> at the time. McIlroy and Wozniacki were together for three years before the golfer called off their engagement in 2014. He and Stoll began dating shortly after.</p><p>A source close to Wozniacki, 33, told Us last month that she “wants no part of his drama.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp6Kueq6vyKWpqLFdmba0ucisqp6rXZm2t7vRnJxmnqKkum7DyJ%2BcZp2inrCiedKtpqWkXZeyp7vRnmSuq12kvaa6jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
