Goodell is a famous Commissioner of the National Football League and an actor. R. Goodell has an estimated net worth of $75 million. This amount of money has mostly been earned since 2006, when he had to replace the previous commissioner of NBL, Paul Tagliabue. Goodell was chosen over five finalists for this position and began his tenure on September 1. Today Robert Goodell is described as one of the most powerful personalities in sports. Also he is known as the President of National Football League Charities – this duty usually comes together with the job of Commissioner.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=roger-goodell-net-worth-75-million></span>Roger Goodell Net Worth $75 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Roger Goodell was born in Jamestown, New York on February 19, 1959. He was the son of Charles Ellswoth Goodell, US Representative and Senator from New York. As a teenager Goodell attended Bronxville High School where he was famous for his achievements in sports – he was a well-known star in school baseball, football and basketball teams, and was even named the school’s athlete of the year. Goodell was even planning to play college football, but after a serious injury he had to forget about a future life with sports. That’s why in 1981 he graduated from Washington & Jefferson College with an economics degree. However, it didn’t stop his passion for football. In 1982 Robert Goodell started to work in the league office in New York as an administrative intern under Pete Rozelle – the commissioner of the NFL from 1960 to 1989. This was one of the first steps to the future R. Goodell’s net worth growth.</p><p>After this placement, Roger’s career became more and more successful. In 1987 he was already an assistant to the president of the American Football Conference – at that time this position belonged to Lamar Hunt. Later thanks to Paul Tagliabue, Goodell filled many business roles in football culminating in 2001, when he became Chief Operating Officer of National Football League.</p><p>This was only the beginning – in 2006 Goodell continued his career, as NFL commissioner after winning a close vote against four other finalists. Since then Robert Goodell’s net worth rose even faster. As the commissioner of the NFL Goodell earned $44.2 million during the 2012-2013. However, his base salary was only $7.2 million and all other moneys were his bonus.</p><p>Even if the main source for the rise of Goodell’s net worth is his career as the commissioner, he has also appeared in several movies. For example, in 2009 he appeared in a semi-biographical American sports drama film. But Goodell’s salary as an actor is actually nothing compared with his estimated net worth as a commissioner.</p><p>Today Goodell lives in New York with his wife Jane Skinner – former Fox News Channel anchor. Together they have twin daughters. Roger continues to work as a commissioner and it looks like his net worth is going to rise even more.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Roger Goodell</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$75 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 19, 1959</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Jamestown, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Washington & Jefferson College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Jane Skinner (m. 1997)</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Charles Goodell</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Michael Goodell, Tim Goodell</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Roger S.
