Both of us were extraordinarily flattered to get such a generous offer from Vivid. We never envisioned ourselves as being adult film stars, especially me in any way shape or form,” he says. “We’re glad that we [took the meeting]. It was a very good meeting that we really, really enjoyed.”</p><p>As <i>Us Weekly</i> previously confirmed, the MTV personalities were offered $85,000 in an advance and 35 percent of the net revenues. The house-flipper said he and Portwood, 27, are mulling over the proposal. “As business people, Amber and I need to consider every offer we get from every different angle. … No matter what offer — we have several offers made to us — we look at it with a pros-and-cons sort of business standpoint,” he tells <i>Us</i>. “I’m sure there are people in the world who are going to judge us that we even took the meeting. I can tell you just from having that meeting, Amber and I gained a whole new respect for that industry that we didn’t have before.”</p><p>It seems Baier may have even gained some respect for fellow <i>Teen Mom OG </i>star <b><a href=#>Farrah Abraham</a></b>, who filmed a <a href=#>sex tape</a> with Vivid in 2013. “Despite our differences with Farrah — and I can only speak for myself — our disagreements with Farrah have nothing to do with the decision she made to do an adult film,” he said of Abraham, with whom he and Portwood have feuded. “I can tell you from getting that offer it’s not an easy decision to make either way. There’s a semblance of respect there that she put herself out there like that. That’s the one thing I can say that we agree with Farrah on.”</p><p>Portwood took to Twitter on Thursday, May 25, to <a href=# rel=noopener>address backlash to the news of her sex tape offer</a>. “I’m really stunned at the reaction from my fans!! If you have anything negative to say stop following now!!” she wrote. “The judgment is terrible and I can’t believe people would just make up their minds without even knowing details or what was said!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><i>Teen Mom OG</i> airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaSpeqOtyJ6pZpmdl7KzecCnm2ahXayys7GMn6OarKSav6awjJuwZq6Zq7alv4ysnLFlpJa9pnnOn52eql2sgXmAkXFoaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
