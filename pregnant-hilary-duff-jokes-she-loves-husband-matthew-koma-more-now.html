The back of the card featured solo snaps of each of the three kids and read, “Buckle up Buttercups, we’re adding one more to this crazy bunch!”</p><p>The pair, who tied the knot in December 2019, are seemingly stronger than ever.

He kind of surprised me and I was like, ‘Yes! Of course! You’re my favorite person in the whole entire world outside of my kids,’” Duff said in June 2019, and added with a laugh, “he knows he comes third.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Duff, who welcomed her first child at the age of 24, has been candid through the years about her ups and downs of motherhood.</p><p>“It was a little isolating in the beginning because I didn’t have any friends that had babies yet,” she said on the “Motherly” podcast in June 2019. “But I had been working for such a long time that it felt like a natural step for me and I always knew I wanted to be a mom. I always knew that was going to be my No. 1 priority in life. So I felt ready on some fronts and a little scared on others, but really I only got scared once I was pregnant, thinking, like, ‘Oh, this is actually really happening. What if this? What if that?’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602afoqSRp8ZusNSfnWain6CytHnSoZxmpJ%2BrsrR5x66qm5memXqurdOtn56vXaC8rq2MpqarnV2jvLh7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
