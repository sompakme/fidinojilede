At one point, Kelly even <a href=#>went out with Matthew’s backup quarterback</a> to win the Los Angeles Rams athlete back. She did not name the other collegiate athlete at the time.</p><p class=p1>“You were the couple that everyone thinks Matthew and I was [and] y’all were the UGA QB and cheerleader that met and never let go,” Kelly added on Tuesday, sharing a pic of Cox, his wife and their three children. “I love y’all.”</p><p class=p1>In a follow-up Instagram Story post, Kelly noted that she “wouldn’t even address” the alleged drama “if it didn’t affect others.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kelly-Stafford-Apologizes-to-Matthew-s-Former-Backup-QB-for-Dating-Story.jpg><p class=p1>“It was so comical the way things were twisted,” Kelly wrote on Tuesday. “It was 16 years ago and if you asked both Matthew and I if we would change anything we did back then … Nope. But we appreciate the laughs.”</p><p class=p3>Kelly and Matthew got married in 2015, going on to <a href=#>welcome daughters</a> Sawyer and Chandler, both 7, Hunter, 5, and Tyler, 4. The Staffords relocated from Detroit — where Matthew was playing for the Lions football team — to Los Angeles in 2021 when he was <a href=#>traded to the Rams</a>.</p><p class=p3>During Kelly’s appearance on Kaitlyn Bristowe’s “Off the Vine” podcast earlier this month, she revealed that it wasn’t “cute” casually dating Matthew in college when she wanted to be in a monogamous relationship.</p><p class=p1>“I hated him. I loved him,” Kelly recalled. “I dated the backup to piss him off, which worked. It upset him. It worked, thankfully.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>According to Kelly, Matthew and his backup lived in the same freshman dorm at UGA.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kelly-Stafford-Apologizes-to-Matthew-s-Former-Backup-QB-for-Dating-Story-2.png><p class=p1>“He would see my car there,” Kelly noted. “At one point, he waited and followed me out and got in my car and wouldn’t get out. [He told me], ‘He’s not right for you.’ Meanwhile, he’s dating 12s out of 10s. … Supermodels.”</p><p class=p1>She added, “I think if you asked anyone who knew us in Georgia, if they thought we would’ve ended up together with four kids they would’ve laughed their asses off.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZyhxm6%2F05qdn6eimXqivM6lpqChqprAbsDOZqSarKSdsrh50q2Yn56fp7G0ecKoo6Wdl5p6tbHApqSarJVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
