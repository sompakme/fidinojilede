However, their determination and passion for their product led them to catch the attention of their neighbors and even strangers who were eager to purchase their unique socks.</p><p>“Grace and Lace started out of a simple act of kindness. A friend who was pregnant shared their sock secret with Melissa, and from there, it has truly touched millions of women’s hearts and legs.” – Rick Hinnant</p><p>Inspired by the demand and positive feedback, Rick suggested selling their socks online. This marked the beginning of their online business journey. As their brand gained traction, they expanded to retail locations, eventually establishing their presence in over 230 stores across the country.</p><p>“We grew from just sewing boot socks to boot socks with lace, leg warmers, scarves, arm warmers, and a whole line of boot socks for kids.

The product is unique, and Melissa and Rick have proven that they know how to grow a business.”</p><p>Barbara made an initial offer of $87,500 for a 5% stake in the company. However, after some negotiation, she revised her offer to meet the Hinnants’ original ask of $175,000 for a 10% stake in the business, with half of the investment in credit.</p><p>The deal was a turning point for Grace and Lace.
