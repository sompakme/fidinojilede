Bounds exclusively told Us Weekly that she was strategic when styling Buteau’s Mavis Beaumont: “The goal was to make sure that the world could see that curvy women, plus-sized women can wear what they want. They can wear color, they can be bold, they can be excited about clothes and clothes can work on their shapes and complexions."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They can wear color, they can be bold, they can be excited about clothes and clothes can work on their shapes and complexions.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The show, which premiered on <a href=#>Netflix</a> on July 13, follows wardrobe stylist Mavis after she dumps her photographer boyfriend for cheating on her. After the split, Mavis moves out of the apartment she shared with him in Manhattan to start a new chapter.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Survival-of-the-Thickest-Costumer-on-Michelle-Buteau-s-Style-Feature.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>“It was important that we showed a distinction between Tribeca and Brooklyn,” Bounds told Us. “When Mavis was in Tribeca, her style was more streamlined — a little bit more color blocked and a little basic in a way.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Bounds continued: “After the breakup, you see her trying to show up and show out more. She wears colors and textures and patterns. She mixes metals. She just wants to pop out. It’s symbolic of adjusting to the Brooklyn lifestyle and really, like, getting into it.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Bounds shared that it was also crucial for Mavis to wear things viewers might not expect her to. “We’re all about body positivity,” Bounds told Us. “Curvier women are put in a box when it comes to dressing, and it was important to Michelle to emphasize that curvy women can be free with their style. That’s why we also see her layering, playing with different lengths.”&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Survival-of-the-Thickest-Costumer-on-Michelle-Buteau-s-Style-02.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Michelle herself is very much into fashion. She loves clothes and she loves to try new things,” Bounds shared.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Some of the labels on the show include <a href=#>Black designers</a> Telfar, Fe Noel, Fenty, Brother Vellies, Dungeon Forward and Haus of Swag. Mavis also wore pieces from size-inclusive brands like <a href=#>Good American</a>, Bacaal and Ulla Popken.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Outside of Survival of the Thickest — Bounds, who has worked in costuming for over 12 years and on other shows, including BMF, Rap Sh!t, Blindspot and more — hopes to debunk the myth that styling is more difficult when it comes to extended sizing.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Survival-of-the-Thickest-Costumer-on-Michelle-Buteau-s-Style-01.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I come from a world where I have to dress women of all sizes,” Bounds said.&nbsp;“Early in my career, I worked What Not to Wear, and I would literally have to dress everybody, you know, every shape and size and get into their backstory.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She concluded: “From there, I learned it’s all about leaning into who the person is. Understanding their shapes and what they want to be highlighted. It doesn’t have to be this big separate thing or concept. Curvy women like that they’re curvy and they don’t need to be made to feel working with them is a chore.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Season 1 of Survival of the Thickest is currently streaming on Netflix.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6jCs8LIr5ilZZ%2BberW0xGaroaGToLK0wIycpqyspaKys3nOp2SmoZOdsq24xGaZrqyVlsK0edKtsKWdXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
