As one of the world's greatest pop icons, she has incorporated her mastery of the material world into her live performances and her image. She's been doing so for decades and it seems like she'll be doing it forever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the legendary pop star, the line between reality and performance has blurred at times, especially when it comes to her personal life. Madonna was married to director, Guy Ritchie, for eight years. They were together in the Oughties, and the dissolution of their marriage got more than a little press attention.</p><p>The media had a lot to say about her divorce, just as the media has a lot to say about 'Madge's' many career moves and reinventions! There was a lengthy custody battle over their children, and Madonna and Guy had very cold communications. This former golden couple is composed of two strong-willed people who definitely struggle to co-parent peacefully.</p><p>Here are 20 hidden truths Madonna and Guy wanted to keep quiet!</p><h2 id=an-injury-kickstarted-their-pain><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>An Injury Kickstarted Their Pain</span></h2><p>It goes without saying that supporting your spouse through thick and thin is recommended after tying the 'eternally binding' knot...especially when times get tough!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We know it can be easy to feel testy sometimes during the more difficult phases of a marriage, but, metaphorically speaking, Madonna and Guy Ritchie needed extra umbrellas.</p><p>When Madonna <a href=#>took a tumble while on tour</a> and broke several bones, Guy felt stifled.</p><h2 id=guy-didn-t-get-his-girl><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Guy Didn't Get His Girl</span></h2><p>Madonna once begged a man to open his heart to her, way back in the Eighties; Madge has always been an advocate for open communication!</p><p>In real life, she had the same desire to connect, but the reality wasn't so great. During her marriage to Guy, the two experienced differences due to having clashing personalities, especially when it came to&nbsp;<a href=#>empathy</a>. Guy struggled with an inability to be there for Madonna emotionally, on the scale that she needed.</p><h2 id=madge-was-hung-up-creatively><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Madge Was 'Hung Up' Creatively</span></h2><p>We all know Madonna as an iconic entertainer who has recorded and performed decades of catchy tunes...and spearheaded some of the most memorable fashion looks of the last century! However, the Madonna we know wasn't the Madonna her then-husband, Guy,&nbsp;<a href=#>knew behind closed doors</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The "private" Madonna was faced with a sticky situation. She and Guy didn't see eye-to-eye over her public image; Guy was actually uncomfortable with her artistry.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madonna Cancels With 45-Minute Noticeâ€¦ Can She Learn From Celine Dion?</a></span></p><h2 id=guy-believed-in-money-over-marriage><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Guy Believed In Money Over Marriage</span></h2><p>To outsiders, this marriage between a director and pop diva seemed like a life of total luxury and endless financial security. The former Mr. and Mrs. Ritchie held opposite opinions concerning their financial assets and how important money was to them.</p><p>Financial issues often put a strain on relationships! These issues had a hand in driving Madonna and Guy apart.</p><p>Guy wasn't <a href=#>subtle</a> at all when he said, "I'm glad I made money."</p><h2 id=divorce-rocked-rocco-s-world><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Divorce Rocked Rocco's World</span></h2><p>Regardless of celebrity status, being a child of divorce can produce so many intense emotions. When children have famous parents, it's even harder for kids to put a filter on how they're feeling, because of all the media exposure!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Madonna and Guy's eldest son, Rocco Ritchie, didn't like being dragged into arguments between his warring parents, during Madonna and Guy's very public divorce. Rocco wasn't shy about his feelings; he <a href=#>cited</a> "stress" in legal documents.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Rules Madonna Imposes On Her Kids (She Never Followed Herself)</a></span></p><h2 id=lyrics-showed-how-much-love-was-lost><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Lyrics Showed How Much Love Was Lost</span></h2><p>Madonna is no stranger to revealing lyrics and she has an uncanny ability to tell a story, no matter how subtle or intricate the story is.</p><p>If you haven't heard a Madonna song as meaningful as "<a href=#>Papa Don't Preach</a>," rest assured that Madge is still sprinkling a lot of deep meaning into&nbsp;her newer lyrics!</p><p>Madonna really opened up when she&nbsp;<a href=#>provided fans</a> with a glimpse into her and Guy's deteriorating relationship.</p><h2 id=dress-you-up-had-meaning-in-the-ritchie-household><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>'Dress You Up' Had Meaning In The Ritchie Household</span></h2><p>Little did Madonna know that, while recording her <a href=#>classic</a>&nbsp;pop tune, "Dress You Up," the literal meaning would eventually hit a little too close to home for her future husband!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Madonna devotees are likely thrilled to discover that she takes her title of iconic style icon so seriously, but she never let Guy forget who was the most fashionable in their household.</p><p>Guy once jokingly<a href=#> revealed</a>&nbsp;that he "never wore the same dresses" as his famous wife.</p><h2 id=madonna-needed-middlemen><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Madonna Needed Middlemen</span></h2><p>Madge has a reputation for being very open about private matters, but she had to get used to no longer having a direct line of communication with her former husband. The line of communication basically shut down after the duo began to experience difficulties.</p><p>Tension mounted when they stopped speaking to each other entirely;&nbsp;<a href=#>according</a> to StyleCaster, Madonna and Guy "Relay(ed) messages through friends hoping it will get back to the other."</p><h2 id=madge-thought-there-was-more-to-love><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Madge Thought There Was More To Love</span></h2><p>Falling in love, Madonna-style, is about 'living to tell' detailed and candid romance stories through the years. Just think about how candid she has been!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As heartbreaking as it may be to hear, the romance in Madonna and Guy's relationship dwindled and Madge had lots to learn. According to Newsweek via <a href=#>Glamour</a>, she pondered love and its 'perfect' perception. She revealed that 'cracks in the veneer' began to appear.</p><h2 id=guy-may-have-been-kept-in-the-dark><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Guy May Have Been Kept In The Dark</span></h2><p>What's the deal, dear?</p><p>By the middle of Madonna and Guy's marriage, the public suspected that there was trouble in paradise for this duo, but the question is...was Guy aware of what was really happening?</p><p>There was an air of mystery over Guy's <a href=#>answer</a> to a question about the happenings in their marriage. When asked if there were problems in his marriage, he responded, "...not that I'm aware of."</p><h2 id=the-ritchies-were-no-longer-rich><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The Ritchies Were No Longer Rich</span></h2><p>One of the biggest pitfalls of divorce, which we all love to ignore, is the amount of energy it takes to deal with post-split financial matters! Not only did Madonna and Guy have to deal with the curiosity of fans and foes...they also weren't exactly having fun <a href=#>divvying up</a>&nbsp;assets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The bicoastal couple was forced to deal with the different divorce rules of their respective countries.</p><h2 id=public-perception-wasn-t-pretty><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Public Perception Wasn't Pretty</span></h2><p>When two famous faces come together, there may be trouble within fandoms!</p><p>Whether people love her or dislike her, Madonna's career has given them plenty to discuss, and the attention from fans was something that Guy perhaps wasn't familiar with. When the pair tied the knot, Guy had to get used to his every move being profiled.</p><p><a href=#>According</a> to The Independent, Guy's fans weren't happy with Madge's public PDA with her husband.</p><h2 id=madge-was-mad-about-a-prenup><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Madge Was Mad About A Prenup</span></h2><p>Unfortunately, Madonna has become well aware of the "three P's" relating to divorce: privacy, protection, and a prenup agreement!</p><p>Hollywood's collective ears were raised when the news broke that she and Guy Ritchie decided against having a prenuptial agreement.&nbsp; Little did Madonna know that a prenup would've been very beneficial.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>According</a> to Showbiz411, people who discovered that Madge had no prenup were very surprised.</p><h2 id=guy-wouldn-t-disguise-his-feelings-for-madonna><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Guy Wouldn't&nbsp;Disguise His Feelings For Madonna</span></h2><p>Seeing our heroes deal with all of their demons publicly, because of their celebrity status, can feel unbelievably sad. Unfortunately for Madonna, her ex-husband's <a href=#>distaste</a> for their private relationship became&nbsp;public knowledge.</p><p>By the end of their marriage, Guy didn't want anything to do with her and had the nad habit of letting friends know exactly how he felt about her.</p><h2 id=mr-ritchie-couldn-t-wait-to-take-his-ring-off><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mr. Ritchie Couldn't Wait To Take His Ring Off</span></h2><p>Hollywood gives us normies the perception that celebs aren't real people with actual emotions, so when we hear of a celeb reacting to a very normal and personal "milestone" in life, we may feel surprised.</p><p>His divorce from Madonna took a great toll on Guy. When his divorce from Madonna was finalized, Guy was elated. <a href=#>According</a> to Time, Guy thanked a higher power when he heard the news.</p><h2 id=madonna-demanded-certain-foods-in-the-house><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Madonna Demanded Certain Foods In The House</span></h2><p>The universe knows Madonna, the entertainer, but not much is known about Madonna, the private wife!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Picturing Madge in this traditional role can feel quite odd, but it turns out she is still extremely similar to all of us. In her household she shared with Guy, the 'material girl' loved to indulge in fruit, <a href=#>according</a> to NJ.com.</p><h2 id=madge-was-willing-to-get-greedy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Madge Was Willing To Get Greedy</span></h2><p>We know by now how messy Guy and Madonna's divorce was, but our girl always held her own throughout the process! Madge always knew her value and refused to back down when financial matters got rough.</p><p><a href=#>According</a> to the BBC, Madonna knew her wealth, literally and metaphorically, and made sure that Guy knew she that was wondering why she should have to share it with him after their divorce.</p><h2 id=guy-couldn-t-find-peace-with-madge-s-pacing><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Guy Couldn't Find Peace With Madge's Pacing</span></h2><p>It doesn't take a 'Material Girl' expert to know that Madonna is a high-energy person. She's been going non-stop in her career for almost forty years. Guy had a different energy level and found it hard to keep up with Madonna.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It didn't matter which area of Madonna's life it was...she lived life in a fast-paced way! Guy really&nbsp;<a href=#>felt</a> "tired of the pace [Madonna] had been keeping since their marriage began."</p><h2 id=no-coffee-for-madge><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>No Coffee For Madge</span></h2><p>The end of Madonna and Guy Ritchie's marriage 'brewed' a lot to the surface that Hollywood may not be ready to hear, no matter how much time has passed!</p><p>We've all been there; we're in the middle of a discussion with our S/O, and the conversation gets a little heated. This happened, in a <a href=#>literal sense</a>, to&nbsp;Guy Ritchie. He once spilled his coffee over an argument.</p><h2 id=madonna-was-afraid-to-fail-for-friends><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Madonna Was Afraid To Fail For Friends</span></h2><p>Despite her star power, Madonna has always been 'true blue' to her self-perception; she has always known how important it was for her to connect with others.</p><p>Madge never lost touch with this reality, even amid the devastating dissolution of her marriage. Madonna frequently <a href=#>reached out</a> to her friends and talked over the problems that plagued her.</p><p><span class="next-single related-single">Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Photos That Change The Way We See Madonna</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Marie Claire UK</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>ABC News</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Independent</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Magazine</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>StyleCaster</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Glamour</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>NME</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>CBS News</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Independent</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Showbizz411</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Belfast Telegraph</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Time Magazine</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>NJ.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>BBC News</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>News.com</a></p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Household Rules Madonna Actually Makes Her Kids Follow</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhpaWWknbavs9JmpJqcn6O7onnAp5tmn6WuerO105yfop1drK6vwIyhpqWkqay8sLCMraZmoZejvLOxjJqZqK2kYsGpscirZJ2hpqS%2FpLGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
