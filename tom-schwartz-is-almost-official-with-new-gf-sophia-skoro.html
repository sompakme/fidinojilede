The pair made headlines last month for a <a href=#>rumored romance</a> when Skoro posted a TikTok video with Schwartz.</p><p>“We actually met on a whim at TomTom,” Schwartz revealed, referring to the bar he co-owns with <strong>Tom Sandoval</strong>. “It’s funny, ironically, around that moment, I made a pledge, not only to myself, but to the universe, that I will not hang out or date. I’m just going to be single and work for the next two years. … Then I bumped into her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Tom-Schwartzs-Partner-Sophia-Skoro-Says-Theyre-%E2%80%98Almost-Official-We-Definitely-Love-Each-Other-1.jpg><p>Skoro made the first move on Schwartz by telling him that he was “hot” while they were in TomTom together. The duo exchanged phone numbers but didn’t talk for a while.</p><p>“She overlooks all my baggage,” Schwartz said when asked his favorite thing about Skoro, calling her “one of the coolest human beings on planet earth, the baddest bitch alive.” (Schwartz also started singing “You Make Me Feel So Young” by <strong>Frank Sinatra</strong>.)</p><p>The reality star also gushed over his almost-girlfriend’s “unconventional sense of humor,” referring to her as “super successful” and “sharp as hell.”</p><p>Internet trolls have criticized Schwartz’s romance with Skoro because of their age difference. However, the VPR star stays unbothered.</p><p>“Honestly, if I was a lecherous old man trolling bars, seeking out young women, I think I would feel gross, but we just bumped into each other,” he explained. “We hit it off.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Tom-Schwartzs-Partner-Sophia-Skoro-Says-Theyre-%E2%80%98Almost-Official-We-Definitely-Love-Each-Other-2.jpg><p>When it comes to dropping the L-word, Skoro said she and Schwartz “definitely love each other.”</p><p>Schwartz was previously married to VPR costar <strong>Katie Maloney</strong> <a href=#>from 2019 to 2022</a>. Following their divorce, he <a href=#>was romantically linked</a> to <strong>Jo Wenberg</strong>, whose name came up multiple times on VPR in the wake of Schwartz and Maloney’s split.</p><p>“Jo is a human being — Jo is a light in my life,” the restaurant owner shared during a February episode of the Bravo show. “I want to clear things up. Jo was never living with me. Was she staying with me sporadically? Yes. She’s not my girlfriend, she never was. We had a whirlwind romance but we are just buds now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp51iwKS01pqprbJdnsBurcumpqysXaSzp7XCopilZaeewal5zZ6uZp%2BWYsCwvMeimGarm6S%2FsHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
