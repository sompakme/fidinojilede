Another breakout? Deep sigh. While a perfectly curated skincare routine can be a huge help in preventing pimples, sometimes acne is going to make an unwanted appearance anyway. It could be due to hormones, pollution, stress, a change in the weather — just about anything.
Prevention is great, but it’s always smart to have a quick-fix solution on hand for when a blemish manages to sneak through."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She pulled out numerous surprisingly affordable picks, including <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these pimple patches</a>, which we recognized instantly!</p><p>“So, I found this recently. It’s super cute,” she said, holding up the convenient, refillable compact mirror case, containing star-shaped pimple patches. While her patches are black, the yellow ones are exactly the same in every other way — and come with Rosé’s same case on Amazon. You can always <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">separately buy black stars</a> to put inside the case too!</p><p>“I don’t get pimples often,” the “On the Ground” singer explained, “but then when I do, I get really big ones. And so when I saw this online, I was so excited to order it. And so it makes getting pimples a bit more fun, I would say,” she said with a giggle before reiterating, “And the case is super cute”!</p><p>These pimple patches are made from 100% hydrocolloid. Hydrocolloid has been found to be an excellent help in absorbing fluid, reducing inflammation, shrinking spots and protecting broken skin from bacteria. These patches are also vegan, cruelty-free, dermatologist-tested and determined safe for every skin type.</p><p>One thing to note about the star shape of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these patches</a> is that it’s not just about looks. The unique shape can actually help target different contours of your face more easily than a circular patch might, especially if you’re breaking out around the corners of your nose, for example, or at the sides of your lips!</p><p>You’ll want to apply these patches to freshly cleaned, dry skin — but before you add moisturizer. Wear them overnight for best results — or for at least six hours before peeling and disposing. Add on another afterward if needed!</p><p><strong>Looking for something else?
