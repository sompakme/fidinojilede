I kept looking around like, 'Where’s Kyle?' I had never seen her show! Those girls are going through their own struggles, and the three of them are like a family. They spend their time together shopping, drinking, sharing woes. I don’t see my friends as much — it’s impossible! What makes Bonnie such a badass is that she doesn’t even consider tomorrow — she has no job, no money, no skills, but she’s gonna figure it out."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelly-clarkson-was-behind-the-theme-song-of-39-american-woman-39><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kelly Clarkson Was Behind The Theme Song Of 'American Woman'</span></h2><p>The theme song for the sitcom is a cover of the hit "American Woman" by Canadian rock band The Guess Who.

There are all these things that we love, and we felt we wanted to represent American Woman and the whole lyric of it — the strength and the boldness and the powerfulness I feel like American women exude."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-american-woman-39-was-canceled><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>'American Woman' Was Canceled</span></h2><p>Unfortunately, the show inspired by Kyle Richards childhood wasn't a big success.

I told her all the time, I said, 'I’m not sharing your stories or Kim's — these are my own stories.' And not only that, it’s a fictionalized version of our life, and our mom being a single mom in the ’70s is the jumping-off point."</p><p>However, the two sisters have made up since, and it seems as if Kathy Hilton ended up being accepting of the show.</p><h2 id=39-american-woman-39-is-a-love-letter-to-kyle-richards-39-s-mother><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>'American Woman' Is A Love Letter To Kyle Richards's Mother</span></h2><p>The reality television star revealed that American Woman is actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a love letter to her late mother Kathleen Richards</a>:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I like to write, but it's hard when you have four kids. But I would write sometimes when, you know, everyone was sleeping or whatever. When my mom passed away, I thought, 'I really wanna share who she was, because she really was a special and unique woman.' And it took my being a mom and an adult to have that extra appreciation for her. I always appreciated her, you know, but I had perspective as I got older. She's strict, and she could get, you know, a temper sometimes or whatever it was. But as an adult you're like well, yeah, hello, she was raising these kids on her own. She was stressed. She wanted the best for us, and you know, she was doing her best like we all are trying to do. And I just really wanted to share that story once I lost my mom as a, I guess, sort of love letter to her, too. And just inspire other women."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=will-39-american-woman-39-ever-get-another-season><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Will 'American Woman' Ever Get Another Season?</span></h2><p>While American Woman got canceled after only one season, Kyle Richards was still very proud of the project.
