The game show has been&nbsp;entertaining viewers since 1975 and made headlines in July 2023 after&nbsp;American Idol host, Ryan Seacrest, announced he was taking over hosting duties when&nbsp;Wheel of Fortune veteran <a href=#>Pat Sajak announced his retirement</a> after 41 seasons. With a new host, many wondered if White was staying on the show, and thankfully, she is continuing alongside Seacrest. However, a new face on the show has forced <a href=#>White to lawyer up and negotiate</a> a new contract after not getting a raise in 18 years, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While&nbsp;Wheel of Fortune has been on for almost 50 years, the retirement of Sajak and the contract negotiations of White has made the show headlines in recent news. As&nbsp;the face of the show,&nbsp;it's easy to wonder how she became a multi-millionaire and how she landed (and remained on)&nbsp;Wheel of Fortune for decades.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Richest Game Show Hosts Of 2019</a></span></p><h2 id=vanna-white-got-her-start-acting>Vanna White Got Her Start Acting</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Biography</a> shared that White moved to Los Angeles in the early '80s to pursue a career in acting. Her earliest shows included&nbsp;Midnight Offerings&nbsp;and&nbsp;Graduation Day. However, acting wasn't paying the bills and in an interview with&nbsp;The Associated Press, White explained that she was so poor she didn't even have a bed in her apartment and slept on the floor. To make ends meet, White used to be a waitress and bartend. Considering White's future role as one of the most famous hosts of all time, she was actually a&nbsp;contestant on&nbsp;The Price is Right&nbsp;while trying to make it big in Los Angeles, as noted by <a href=#>Upworthy</a>.&nbsp;<a href=#>Wheel of Fortune</a><a href=#> fans noticed</a> White on the game show while rewatching older episodes. Two years after appearing as a contestant, White got her big break.</p><h2 id=wheel-of-fortune-was-her-big-break>Wheel Of Fortune Was Her Big Break</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After years of struggling to find work, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parade</a> shared that White auditioned to be the host of&nbsp;Wheel of Fortune among 200 other hopefuls. What separated White apart from the other possible hosts? Merv Griffin&nbsp;shared on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official website</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;"[White] turned the letters the best" and&nbsp;had a "brotherly and sisterly chemistry" with Pat Sajak. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC4</a> explained that White was joining the game show after&nbsp;Wheel of Fortune's original host&nbsp;Susan Stafford left her hosting duties for a new opportunity.</p><p>Four years after joining the game show,&nbsp;Wheel of Fortune was bringing in millions of viewers and $100 million a year. White soon became known for her beautiful smile and dazzling dresses. The show's official website shared that White has worn over 7,000 dresses during her time and fans can actually vote for their favorite look on the website. White shared with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a> that designers send her and the show's costume designer different outfits and they ultimately select their favorites. Between flipping letters for Sajak, dazzling outfits, and a charismatic personality, White has been earning an astounding $3 million annually from her role as co-host on&nbsp;Wheel of Fortune.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As aforementioned, White is now in contract negotiations after not receiving a raise in 18 years. Considering she's one of the <a href=#>most popular game show hosts of all time</a>, White is worth the big bucks.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Richest Daytime Talk Show Hosts In The World, As Of 2023</a></span></p><h2 id=books-charities-and-tv-cameos>Books, Charities, And TV Cameos</h2><p>Over the years, Vanna White's celebrity has continued to grow. Her name and likeliness have been in everything from books to songs to TV shows and movies. She has appeared as herself in shows like&nbsp;Fresh Off the Boat, The King of Queens, and&nbsp;Full House. White has also dabbled in producing after being the executive producer for movies like Low Country and Black Dispatch. More interesting, White has made a killing for one of her hobbies outside of TV and movies: knitting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Working with Lion Brand Yarn, White has had different lines of yarn patterns, textures, and designs, according to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Craft Yarn Council</a>. The website noted that White's yarn line does so well that she and Lion Brand Yarn have donated millions to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital over the years. White has also generated her love of reading and writing into a successful line of books. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, <a href=#>White has eight books to her name</a> that range from gift giving to crocheting to an autobiography called&nbsp;Vanna Speaks.</p><p>Because of White's successful business ventures, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Capitalism</a>&nbsp;explained how White has turned money into even more money by investing in expensive jewelry, works of art, and properties. What's even more fascinating is that White earns&nbsp;$15 million a year from casinos using her image on slot machines. Even without hosting&nbsp;Wheel of Fortune, White is earning millions because of her own stardom and the projects she created outside of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Richest Game Show Hosts Of All Time</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Biography</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parade</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thrift Books</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Biography</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1pr7ErGShp6diw6K6zZpksKCZqbJursScmKadXZZ6qbvLpbCwp5%2BZerTAwKtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
