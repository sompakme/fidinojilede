Whether it’s a concert she is performing or an award show she's attending, she loves to change her outfits a lot! Maybe she’s trying to be like Blake Lively who shocked us in 2014 when she changed into ten outfits in just one day. We would love to live in these girls' closet. Stars just love changing their outfits and we can’t blame them, we would too if we had their shopping budget and social status. Sometimes, it’s just hard to choose one outfit to wear to an event. When you have unlimited funds, the sky is the limit on the kinds of clothes you can score.</p><p>Carrie Underwood isn’t one to show off a lot of skin. Her outfits are&nbsp;foxy but classy. There have been times when Carrie Underwood has changed into more than ten outfits in just one day. We would think that going through all that would be exhausting, but these girls love it. Check out these 25 outfits Carrie Underwood wore that still amazes us.</p><h2 id=all-in-black><strong>All in Black</strong></h2><p>For her CMA performance in 2015, she decided to hit the stage all in black. She wore an all-black minidress by Erevos Aether and shoes by Lust for Life. We just love those leggings she's wearing. It's like she turned her stilettos into thigh-high boots. Not only is she a classy lady, but she believes in making the world a better place. “Successful people have a social responsibility to make the world a better place and not just take from it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-loves-sequins><strong>She Loves Sequins</strong></h2><p>Talk about looking like a goddess. This cape dress was one of her looks at the 2017 CMAs. She definitely knows&nbsp;how to stand out among the other celebs at a big event like this. While she might know how to rock the red carpet, Underwood knows how to unwind when the heels comes off. “Before bed, I read a book or flip on the radio&nbsp;— I'm not picky, I'll just turn it on and see what comes up. I burn a yummy lavender-scented candle.”</p><h2 id=she-is-smashing-in-red><strong>She is Smashing in Red</strong></h2><p>She pulled off another smashing red look with this peek-a-boo dress. She is fully clothed and yet, she is still throwing off those foxy vibes. She's admitted that she doesn’t always try on the clothing she wears before the event.</p><p><strong>“When we get the running order of the show, we’re like, ‘Okay these are complicated, so we’re going to need more time,’ so we try to just plan where things that might need a little more time get a little more time,”</strong></p><p>shared Carrie. “And there are easy changes, like, ‘Oh, we have five minutes, that’s a lifetime in TV-quick-change world. We make the time count.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-a-goddess-in-blue><strong>She’s A Goddess in Blue</strong></h2><p>Blue is definitely her color and she looks amazing in this floor-length dress. With dresses like these, it’s no wonder she likes to change into so many. She is one girl who is very independent in the industry as well as at home.</p><p><strong>“My mom had a job, and she also took care of us, and she also took care of Dad. I always saw her pulling triple duty, doing more than I ever felt like she needed to.</strong></p><p>I made a promise to myself that it would be more of a team effort in my family someday. And because of that, I became more independent.”</p><h2 id=she-shines-in-gowns><strong>She Shines in Gowns</strong></h2><p>Was it her wedding day when she wore this white gown? No, it was just the CMAs, but when you are Carrie Underwood, you can use any excuse to wear a gown. She is a creative person and that’s clear in her style choices.</p><p><strong>“I, like a lot of people who are creative, need to step away. I can't have stuff to write about if I don't have a life.</strong></p><p>If I talk to people, hang out with my friends and hang out with my husband, I feel like I have better things to bring to the table.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=golden-robot><strong>Golden Robot&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Only a woman like Carrie Underwood could pull off a dress like this golden ensemble. She has admitted that she gets her healthy glow because she takes really good care of herself.</p><p><strong>"My life can get pretty crazy at times.&nbsp; I try to make sure I get a little 'me time' on a daily basis.</strong></p><p>Whether it’s that hour in the morning when I get to work out, getting a pedicure, or just getting to spend some alone time with my husband, every day should have a time that’s just for me," she admitted.</p><h2 id=not-everyone-can-shine-through-charcoal><strong>not everyone can shine through charcoal&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>There's a lot going on here, and yet, between the&nbsp;charcoal color, layers of fabrics, and shimmery details, Underwood still shines right through it. She's wearing the dress; the dress isn't wearing her.&nbsp;Underwood's admitted that&nbsp;Reese Witherspoon and Charlize Theron are two of her fashion and beauty icons in Hollywood.</p><p><strong>“They are beautiful, but in a natural way. They look like they take care of themselves but don’t do anything too crazy.</strong></p><p>They always look and act classy." She couldn’t be more right we love their style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=underwood-can-rock-any-style><strong>Underwood can rock any style</strong></h2><p>She may like her long dresses, but she has a great pair of legs so that means the mini dresses always look fantastic on her. She might look like she always has it together, but she doesn't. Underwood is very vocal about the roles of women how she doesn’t like expectations that are put on women.</p><p><strong>“It seems women are expected to be so much more than men, which means we have to work that much harder. We're the ones under the microscope.</strong></p><p>We're expected to sound perfect. We're expected to look perfect all the time. We're expected to be style-setters, whereas the boys roll onto the stage in their jeans, T-shirts and baseball caps.”</p><h2 id=the-lady-in-white><strong>The Lady in White</strong></h2><p>Even when pregnant, she is one of the most beautiful women in the room. She looks amazing in white and she still manages to look foxy. She appreciates the place she is at in her life.</p><p><strong>“I want people to think of me as a nice person. I really am so blessed.</strong></p><p>All of this has been a great experience and I thank the American public so much for putting me in this position. I appreciate every second of it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-barbie-dress><strong>The Barbie Dress</strong></h2><p>Obviously, this is the kind of dress any girl would want, especially if you played with Barbies growing up. One of the reasons why she looks amazing in everything she wears is because she eats really healthy.</p><p><strong>"I do my best to eat healthy and work out. I am a vegan, so that certainly helps. It’s hard to be vegan and not stay pretty lean.</strong></p><p>As far as posture goes, I could certainly work on that. It’s easy to stand up straight when I know the camera is pointed at me, but I will see pictures of myself when I’m caught off-guard and realize how slumped over I am."</p><h2 id=a-little-magic-never-hurt-anyone><strong>A little magic never hurt anyone</strong></h2><p>How could you not love a gown like this one? It’s breathtaking and it’s one of her&nbsp;outfit changes that definitely stole the show.&nbsp;Underwood's been around for some time, and yet, her career is still teaching her lessons.</p><p><strong>“I think after coming off of American Idol, people kind of expect you to just be awesome all the time, and we're still learning.</strong></p><p>I had a lot of stage experience, but it was in a 200-seat theater, you know. It wasn't thousands of people in front of me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blue-bell><strong>Blue Bell</strong></h2><p>Seriously how cute is this dress? She looks like the bell of the ball. Underwood always looks on point and it's even more important to dress to impress when she's touring.</p><p><strong>“Tours can be extremely different from one another; it can depend on whether we're doing the dancers or just one artist.</strong></p><p>The process usually involves coming up with visuals with the creative director, looking at what the acts might be if the tour is split between various sections," said costume designer Marina Toybina.</p><h2 id=head-to-toe-sequins><strong>Head to Toe Sequins</strong></h2><p>One of her signature looks always involves sequins. She loves the look and so do we.&nbsp;If there's one thing she's learned from other celebs is that there's always the possibility of a wardrobe malfunction, especially if they're performing on stage.&nbsp;“Underneath every skirt, every dress, I’m wearing shorts. So that everyone in the world knows, if I ever fell down, nobody would get a peek at anything.”</p><h2 id=glitz-and-glam><strong>Glitz and glam&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Here's another absolutely stunning ensemble. There is a lot of work that goes into preparing her outfit choices. “With Carrie, her creative director would come up with certain creatives, she would approve, and I'd come in after that process and come up with pieces that'd work best for each section. Then I'd sit with Carrie one-on-one and see what she prefers," said&nbsp;Marina Toybina. "If this is a high-beat act, what kind of shoes are we going to go with so she can move around the stage? Can the piece be a little bit heavier?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-not-about-the-drama><strong>she's not about the drama</strong></h2><p>No matter if Underwood is on the red carpet or at a wedding, Underwood always dresses to impress and tries to reflect who she is through her clothes. When she heard that Hayden Panettiere based her portrayal of the main character in the TV series Nashville on Carrie, she wanted to set the record straight. “I’m not like that at all. It’s juicy, but I hope not everybody thinks that everything goes down like that in Nashville, and we’re evil. To be honest, I’ve been fortunate enough to work with other types of music — and we’re the least drama-rific people.”</p><h2 id=being-true-to-herself><strong>Being true to herself</strong></h2><p>No matter what her costume designer tells her, it's important for Underwood to stay true to herself. And this little number is something you can tell she's loving and is totally comfortable wearing. When it comes to fashion choices or her career, she's learned to have a thick skin.</p><p><strong>“At first, it was hard to sit down and read the things that people were saying. A lot of people would've worked their way up to this position and would've gotten a thick skin over a few years' time.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For me, though, all this happened in a few months.”</p><h2 id=she-picks-a-tribal-dress><strong>She Picks A Tribal Dress</strong></h2><p>This was a pretty cool look for her and it was one of the more original dresses she went for. The designers pay careful attention to the clothing Carrie wears before she wears it.</p><p><strong>“We dissect each costume prior to opening night, so if something happens like a rhinestone coming off, we know how to replace them.</strong></p><p>We make sure there's enough stock just in case something goes wrong in a cleaning process or the handling of the costumes while traveling. There are always enough extra accessories to make sure you can rebuild it.”</p><h2 id=she-s-as-feminine-as-she-is-edgy><strong>She's as feminine as she is edgy</strong></h2><p>For the 2014 Billboard Music Awards, Carrie performed with Miranda Lambert and the two went for an edgy rockstar look. Like most celebrities, Carrie finds the focus on her at times to be weird. “As far as Twitter, I'll be in a restaurant and I'll get home and somebody tweeted and they talked about what I ordered and what I was wearing. In some cases, that could be dangerous, because you don't want everybody to know where you are every second of every day.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dressed-to-the-nines><strong>dressed to the nines</strong></h2><p>Carrie Underwood just seems to be able to pull off any type of gown and this one is a glamorous choice. There is so much that goes into making a dress decision.</p><p><strong>“Hosting an award show, each time you're on camera, it's something new, and you're looking the part.</strong></p><p>If you're presenting an award, you want to be a little more elegant, while if you're presenting a performance, you have the opportunity to be more edgy and play with fashion.”</p><h2 id=from-the-future><strong>From the future</strong></h2><p>She’s sure to catch anyone’s eye with a shiny dress like this one. She wore it to the 2017 Billboard Music Awards and she was a sight for sore eyes. She’s definitely received some flak over the years because she became a mega star almost overnight. “I feel like I am a celebrity for no reason, like people are resentful I didn't have to play bars for 10 years to get a record deal.”</p><p>References:&nbsp;<a href=#>tasteofcountry.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>elle.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>iheart.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>glamour.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYmp6sMHTn6Ctq12YrrO%2ByJ5krqaUmr%2B4u86dZLCnopp6tbTArWSsrJmhuW6tzJqxnmWlqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
