“Gizelle’s amazing,” Jason, 37, exclusively told Us Weekly at BravoCon, which was held in Las Vegas from Friday, November 3, to Sunday, November 5. “We’re great. We’re always in a good place.”
The Winter House star added that “there’s never anything really going wrong” with the pair, and said he gets “nothing but, ‘How are things?’” texts from Gizelle, 53."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In October, Gizelle <a href=#>exclusively gave Us insight</a> into her and Jason’s blossoming relationship.</p><p>“I’m super happy that Jason kind of understands me, gets my life. I clearly understand his life,” she said while discussing <a href=#>season 8 of RHOP</a>. “He has been a breath of fresh air and someone that I can just tell everything to, and I know it stays with him.”</p><p>Gizelle noted that she doesn’t “feel the need” to put a title on their romance.</p><p>“I just am appreciating the time that we have and the time that we spend together,” she said. “We have so much fun when we’re together, I’m just happy doing what we’re doing.”</p><p>One of the reasons Gizelle told Us she thinks the relationship has been working is because they’re “not putting any pressure on it.”</p><p>“We’re not allowing other people to make us put pressure on it. And we’re there for each other,” she explained. “And my dad passed recently. He understands [that]. His mother passed a while ago, and so he’s just been able to see me for who I am, and I appreciate that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Jason has made a couple of appearances on the next season of RHOP, Gizelle said she has no interest in being a part of Winter House.</p><p>“I don’t understand it. When he FaceTimed me, there was <a href=#><strong>[Tom] Schwartz</strong></a> in the bed with potato chips everywhere, and it was just a little disgusting,” Gizelle said. “It’s definitely not my scene, but if he invited me, I would go for him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawoZ6psrN5x6isrJ2jYreiv86nZJyZnZq%2FsLqMoKysoJWoerDCxKtkoKGqmrmtsYybqbKZnql6s7vMmqWcnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
