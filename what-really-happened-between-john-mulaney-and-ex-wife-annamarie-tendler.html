John Mulaney, who was <a href=#>in a recovery program for substance use</a> in late 2020, and <a href=#>his wife of nearly a decade</a>, Annamarie Tendler, got a divorce in early 2021.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why John Mulaney May Never Get Married Again</a></span></p><p>In late 2020, Mulaney, who has long been open in his standup about his experience with substance abuse struggles, made the decision to seek treatment, a move that generated many headlines and commentary via social media. While the Mulaneys opted to honor John's extremely personal decision by choosing not to comment on the specifics surrounding the situation, an unrelated piece of news surrounding John's personal life was revealed to the public only three months after his first announcement: he and Annamarie were getting a divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2014, John Mulaney and Annamarie Tendler officially tied the knot. After saying their "I do's" the couple was constantly asked if they were planning on expanding their family. Mulaney made it clear that he didn't want children, however that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. After a stint in rehab following news of John's substance abuse struggles, he filed for divorce from Tendler, shocking fans everywhere! It's clear Annamarie was blindsided by the divorce, revealing she did not want to part ways. Well, not only has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John moved on rather quickly</a> with actress Olivia Munn, but the duo are officially expecting their first child together. Fans have pointed out John's change of heart when it comes to having kids, however it's the timeframe of dating Munn for only 3 months that have them puzzled. Despite the questions, many fans have poured in tons of support over the news, but <a href=#>Annamarie doesn't seem to be too happy</a> about it all (obviously).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on January 28, 2022: </strong>In November 2021, Malcolm Hiệp Mulaney was born. Ever since his birth, both of his parents (John Mulaney and Olivia Munn) have shared many adorable pictures and videos of Malcolm on their Instagram accounts. The two seem to be very proud parents, and <a href=#>their relationship with one another has also grown stronger</a> since the birth of their son. While both John Mulaney and Annamarie Tendler remain tight-lipped about the details behind their divorce, they do seem to be finding ways to move on. Mulaney, of course, is spending lots of time with his new baby, while Tendler has been focusing on her art, and she told Harper's Bazaar that things "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">can only go up from here</a>".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on December 12th, 2022 by Abigail Thomas: </strong>John Mulaney and Olivia Munn have been busy all year raising their son Malcolm Mulaney. Their son was born in late 2021, which shocked many fans as Mulaney had previously stated in stand-up routines that he had no intention of having children with ex-wife Annamarie Tendler. The drastic change of tune caused fans to speculate if Mulaney had cheated on Tendler, and his fast transition into a relationship with Munn did not help his case. Tendler has not formally accused Mulaney, as they have remained relatively silent on their divorce, but she certainly was not pleased by his relationship with Munn.</p><h2 id=a-marriage-not-so--39-gorgeous-39-what-lead-to-john-mulaney-and-annamarie-tendler-39-s-divorce>A Marriage Not-So-'Gorgeous': What Lead To John Mulaney And Annamarie Tendler's Divorce</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The revelation of Mulaney's difficult struggles with substance abuse cast a spotlight on the actor's personal life after overwhelming support from fans began pouring in over social media; many supporters, from fans to famous faces, offered words of support for Mulaney after he entered treatment. While Mulaney and those close to him have not revealed any specifics surrounding what he went through during treatment, it was revealed Mulaney himself decided to take action and chose to seek help.</p><p>He also chose to embark on the major choice to divorce his wife, Annamarie Tendler. In February, news broke <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mulaney would be heading home</a> after finishing in-patient treatment, according to Vulture. The timeline between Mulaney's homecoming and the divorce announcement lines up. According to Page Six, the actor "asked for a divorce from Tendler three months ago," which would have been the same month that he completed treatment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While no official reason for Mulaney's decision to end their marriage has been revealed as of this writing, fans began pondering why the couple, who have always seemed so publicly in love, began having trouble. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One fan commented</a> via Buzzfeed News, "it must have been so hard on her afterward to stick by him so she must be devastated, but ultimately it may save a lot of heartbreak down the line..."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What John Mulaney Has Said About Why He Got Divorced</a></span></p><h2 id=john-mulaney-moved-on-fast---with-olivia-munn>John Mulaney Moved On Fast - With Olivia Munn!</h2><p>The tone of Mulaney-related social media commentary drastically changed when he re-entered public conversation following the announcement he had found new love in the midst of heartbreak: Mulaney had begun seeing actress Olivia Munn, and their romance sparked a strong amount of interest. The internet collectively gasped after the pair, who had known one another for years, was revealed to be taking their friendship to a new level.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While surprise seemingly became the default emotion surrounding any mention of Mulaney and Munn together, their relationship isn't new. The two have known one another for a few years, and Munn has even been vocal about how much she admires Mulaney.</p><p>The actress was eager to make Mulaney's acquaintance in the early 2010s before he and Tendler had officially tied the knot, according to Vanity Fair. Mulaney's longtime friend Seth Meyers had invited both Mulaney and Munn to his wedding, and Munn took to Mulaney well. She later revealed how she wanted to be pals and get to know him; Munn revealed she asked him "Do you and your fiancée want to go and have dinner or something and hang out?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Matters between Mulaney and his ex-wife seem to be cordial as he moves forward. Annamarie was adamant in letting fans and supporters know she plans to stay present in John Mulaney's life as he navigates life post-treatment in the former couple's divorce announcement. Only time will tell if Mulaney will detail the specifics of his divorce in a future standup show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How John Mulaney And Olivia Munn Are Raising Their Son</a></span></p><h2 id=john-mulaney-and-olivia-munn-have-a-child-together>John Mulaney And Olivia Munn Have A Child Together</h2><p>Yes, we're just as shocked as you are! Only months into their new relationship, John Mulaney and Olivia Munn announced they were expecting their first child together. This not only took fans by surprise, but considering Mulaney had also made it clear <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he didn't want kids</a>, it led to quite a bit of confusion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While everyone changes their mind every now and again, it seems as if fans are slightly confused over the sudden change of heart. Munn revealed that she is super "excited" about the pregnancy, and has had a few laughs over her journey. The actress shared that all her baby bump is allowing her to wear are "oversized sweatpants", but what does Annamarie Tendler think of all this?</p><p>After making her first public appearance since her split from John, Annamarie was pressed about the recent news, and while she didn't respond directly, a source close to Tendler revealed that she is certainly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">having a difficult time taking in the news</a>, and we don't blame her one bit.</p><p>The quick turn around of Mulaney getting a divorce and beginning to see Munn also had fans questioning if something had gone on behind the scenes. <a href=#>Rumors circulated that Mulaney had cheated on Tendler with Munn</a>. While just rumors, there was one source who claimed Tendler had confirmed the affair, yet there is no record of Tendler making the accusation. Mulaney and Munn are steadfast that they did not begin seeing each other until after Mulaney asked Tendler for a divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Inside Pete Davidson And John Mulaney's Friendship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKCeYrq2uMCnnLJlkaO7ornAq6CeZaSau6W4xKtknaGmpL%2BksYyoo6KumZZ6rsHNp2SpqpWcu6K6wrJm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
