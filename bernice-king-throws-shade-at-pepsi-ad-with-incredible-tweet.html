She said that the commercial, which was supposed to promote “living in the now,” is “something that [she’s]&nbsp;about.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5eys7rInJxmo5mjtG7A1qKrrZ2iYr2mvNKiZG5oYmd%2Fc3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
