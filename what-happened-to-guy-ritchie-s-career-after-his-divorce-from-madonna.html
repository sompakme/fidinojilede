The public's response was so unfavorable, it's widely considered to be one of the worst movies of all time.</p><p>When Ritchie and <a href=#><strong>Madonna</strong></a> divorced in 2008, their respective careers continued. But did Ritchie ever experience renewed success following the embarrassment of Swept Away?</p><h2 id=guy-ritchie-said-he-felt-39-punished-39-by-the-public-due-to-the-bad-reception-of-39-swept-away-39>Guy Ritchie Said He Felt 'Punished' By The Public Due To The Bad Reception Of 'Swept Away'</h2><p>In 1974, an Italian film titled Swept Away challenged viewers with its themes of class struggles, gender, and sexuality. Decades later, Ritchie would direct a remake of the film starring Madonna in 2002. The two were newly married at the time.</p><p>Ritchie was coming off two highly successful films at the time. The first being Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, which earned critical praise and a big box office gross. The second was Snatch, which nearly quadrupled the previous film’s gross at the box office. However, Swept Away would be universally panned by critics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ritchie explained his thought process by saying that he didn't want to become typecast as a director.</p><p>"My feeling was as though there’s a terrible danger to getting stuck in a particular genre as a filmmaker, so you’ve gotta be brave enough to jump out of your familiar territory," <a href=#>he said</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instar48633168.jpg><p>Ritchie defended the film <a href=#>in an interview with MTV in 2007</a>.</p><p>"Look, it's a movie that I like. It's the movie I intended to make. From my point of view, it was a film that couldn't transcend the external factors. Maybe it would have been wiser had I identified those to begin with. We did what we wanted to do, and we were both happy with what we did."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Things Madonna And Guy Ritchie Want Hollywood To Ignore About Their Divorce</a></span></p><p>Ten years later, Ritchie reflected on the experience <a href=#>in a 2017 interview with Yahoo Movies</a>.</p><p>"The experience of Swept Away was quite a painful one, and it was a trial by fire," he said. "There were a couple of issues. One was making it with my ex-wife, and two was making it on the back of my previous films."</p><p>It turns out that Ritchie's goal of expanding his horizons backfired in a big way.</p><p>"That was the first time I jumped out of my familiar territory, and boy, did I get punished for it!"</p><p>Ritchie concluded his thoughts by saying that although he enjoyed the experience of making Swept Away, "I didn’t enjoy the experience of releasing it!"</p><h2 id=madonna-said-she-felt-39-incarcerated-39-during-her-marriage-to-guy-ritchie>Madonna Said She Felt 'Incarcerated' During Her Marriage To Guy Ritchie</h2><p>Madonna's divorce from Ritchie was confirmed in the fall of 2008. The announcement ended months of speculation that the marriage was on the rocks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For many years, the public speculated as to why the two got divorced. While there has never been specific explanations, both Madonna and Ritchie have left clues along the way.</p><p>Ritchie addressed the divorce <a href=#>in an interview with Details Magazine in 2011</a>.</p><p>"It's definitely not something I regret," he said. "I love the kids that came out of it. But you move on, don't you… I stepped into a soap opera and I lived in it for quite a long period of my life. I'll probably be more eloquent on it 10 years from now."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instar48867492.jpg><p>In 2015, <a href=#>Madonna told Jonathan Ross</a> that her marriage to Ritchie ended because of timing. That same year, she opened up to The Sun and revealed even more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I did sometimes find myself in a state of conflict," she said. "There were times when I wanted to express myself as an artist in ways that I don't think my ex-husband was comfortable with."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s How Much Madonna Had To Pay Ex-Husband Guy Ritchie</a></span></p><p>Many noticed that Madonna's image and music became much more provocative in the wake of the divorce.</p><p>"There were times I felt incarcerated," she added. "I wasn't really allowed to be myself."</p><p>Madonna said that compromise is a key factor in a relationship's success, but she needs to find a man who will accept her for who she is.</p><p>"It doesn't mean marriage is a bad thing," she said. "But if you're an artist, you've got to find someone who accepts who you are and is comfortable with that."</p><h2 id=guy-ritchie-has-achieved-renewed-success-following-his-divorce-from-madonna>Guy Ritchie Has Achieved Renewed Success Following His Divorce From Madonna</h2><p>In the wake of his divorce, Ritchie found success with the 2009 Sherlock Holmes film starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film was so successful, Ritchie directed the sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows in 2011.
