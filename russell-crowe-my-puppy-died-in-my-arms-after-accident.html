I think the other dogs on the farm are going to get jealous. Pretty funny,” the <a href=#>Les Misérables actor</a> wrote alongside the December 2022 <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter </a>snap.</p><p>The New Zealand native’s loss comes exactly two years after his father, John, died at 85 in March 2021.
