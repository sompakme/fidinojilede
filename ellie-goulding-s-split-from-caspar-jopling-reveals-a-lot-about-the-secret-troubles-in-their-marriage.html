But when she's not dominating UK and global <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong> charts, Goulding is a devoted mother to 2-year-old Arthur and a loving wife to art dealer Caspar Jopling.</p><p><a href=#>The two tied the knot back in 2019</a> in a lavish star-studded ceremony held at the prestigious York Minster Cathedral in England, and <a href=#>welcomed their son shortly thereafter</a>. Sadly, despite their spectacular beginnings, Jopling and Goulding’s marriage has not been devoid of turbulent times. Back in June, the duo made headlines when reports emerged that they’d decided to go their separate ways. Here’s what they’ve let slip about the secret troubles that led to their split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inside-ellie-goulding-and-caspar-jopling-39-s-marital-issues>Inside Ellie Goulding And Caspar Jopling's Marital Issues</h2><p>Held at England's prestigious York Minster Cathedral in 2019, Ellie Goulding and Caspar Jopling's nuptials were the stuff of dreams. Attended by both celebrity and actual royalty, the wedding seemed like the perfect beginning to a fairytale marriage.</p><p>Unfortunately, Jopling and Goulding were married for only four years before reports emerged that their marriage had hit a rough patch. According to The Sun, the marriage had been severely impacted by the couple’s busy schedules, leading to a split in June 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ellie-goulding-and-caspar-jopling-sharing-a-kiss-at-their-lavish-york-minster-wedding.jpg><p>Per an inside source, the twosome's marriage had been on the rocks for a solid six months before their June 2023 split. “Things have been bad for at least six months now,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the source revealed to The Sun</a>, “both parties have been really trying to be happy together for the sake of their son, but these things can only take so long before it is untenable.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The duo had reportedly gone to great lengths to conceal their marital troubles in a bid to protect their young son. “Ellie's team were insisting that she and Caspar were happy, that any suggestions of them being apart were totally untrue and now this. It has all been very mysterious indeed,” the source added. “There had been suggestions of troubles and even a full on split for quite some time, but they kept insisting everything was totally fine.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ellie Goulding Dated A Lot Of Famous People Before Falling For An Art Dealer</a></span></p><p>However, as the cracks in the marriage deepened, the two eventually decided to call it quits. “They’ve tried to find a compromise where they continue to share lots of time together for their son Arthur, but outside of that sometimes live separate lives for now.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ellie-goulding-grew-close-to-politician-zac-goldsmith-after-her-split-from-caspar-jopling>Ellie Goulding Grew Close To Politician Zac Goldsmith After Her Split From Caspar Jopling</h2><p>Following her split from Jopling, Ellie Goulding was spotted in the company of conservative politician Lord Zac Goldsmith. The two were first pictured together in June 2022, but reportedly grew closer in the wake of Goulding’s split from Jopling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ellie-goulding-at-capital-s-2023-summertime-ball.jpg><p>“Ellie and Zac met some time ago and became pals,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an inside source revealed to Mirror UK</a>. “They have been in touch since Ellie and Caspar decided to separate and she has shared what she is going through.

Though estranged, they hesitated to file for divorce.</p><p>"There is no discussion of a divorce and neither of them have been in a new relationship," a source close to the couple revealed to The Sun back in June.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The priority is to keep good friends and remain amicable whilst they work out their next steps, so they can stay close and enjoy being mum and dad to Arthur. There will always be a lot of love between them despite some difficult times, and they want the best for each other."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/elle-goulding-and-husband-caspar-jopling-leaving-serpentine-summer-party-2019.jpg><p>Fortunately, despite being on the precipice of divorce, Jopling and Goulding eventually decided to reconcile, primarily for the sake of their 2-year-old son.</p><p>“[Ellie] is determined to make things work with Caspar and is committed to giving things another go,” a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">source recently revealed to The Sun</a>. “She knows it is the right thing to do for the sake of their young son because she wants them to be a proper family unit,” the source continued. “It has been an incredibly tough year for both Ellie and Caspar, but they have had some very frank conversations and are both on the same page. There is a lot of love between them.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ellie-goulding-s-split-from-caspar-jopling-reveals-a-lot-about-the-secret-troubles-in-their-marriage.jpg><p>However, as it turns out, Goulding had to make one very specific compromise to get Jopling on board with the reconciliation; ending her burgeoning relationship with Tory politician Zac Goldsmith. According to The Sun, the ‘Love Me Like You Do’ singer cut off all contact with Goldsmith, going as far as unfollowing him on social media.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Poison's Bret Michaels And C.C.

She is determined to make things work with Caspar and is committed to giving things another go,” The Sun’s insider revealed. “Caspar has made it clear that they can only try again if she completely cuts off her friendship with Zac and she has agreed. That has meant no seeing each other, no calls and she’s even unfollowed him on Instagram.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpaSZmnqou9Slm6Kml2K1tr%2FBmqWdZZOWwLGt0WahqKicnruoecOiraiqk5p6rq3Rq6Can5VitrS%2F1J6qaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
