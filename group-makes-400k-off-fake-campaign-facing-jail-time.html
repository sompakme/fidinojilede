As of late, several cases have questioned its nature including the case of <a href=# id=auto-tag_new-jersey_1 data-tag=new-jersey>New Jersey</a> couple who reportedly teamed up with a Philadelphia homeless veteran in an elaborate scam to cash in on the nice gesture.</p><p>Couple Mark D’Amico, Kate McClure and homeless veteran Johnny Bobbitt Jr. were arrested Wednesday evening and will face conspiracy and theft by deception charges, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ABC News</a> reports. Bobbit, who was previously on the run for the case, was also charged with being a fugitive from justice. He is currently being transferred from Philly to&nbsp;Burlington County.</p><p>The story behind the group’s GoFundMe came to be in 2017 when McClure said she was stranded around midnight on the I-95 exit ramp near Philadelphia when she ran out of gas. Bobbit, who was resting under an overpass, came over and gave her his last $20.</p><p>The deed inspired McClure and her boyfriend D’Amico to create a GoFundMe in an effort to pay it forward. The story <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">quickly went viral</a> when they raised $402,706 from 14,347 individual contributors instead of the proposed $10,000. They went from talk show to talk show playing up their newfound friendship.</p><p>Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">released a statement</a>&nbsp;about the case Thursday (Nov. 15), confirming the group decided to make up a heartwarming story to make money.</p><p>“Less than an hour after the GoFundMe campaign went&nbsp;live—McClure in a text exchange with a friend—stated that the story about Bobbitt assisting her was ‘completely made up,’” the statement reads. “She did not run out of the gas on the I-95 off-ramp, and he did not spend his last $20 helping her. Rather, D’Amico, McClure and Bobbitt conspired to fabricate and promote a feel-good story that would compel donors to contribute to their cause.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gofundme-controversy-facebook-1542312451.jpg><p>Before the swindle was exposed, the group of friends was already falling apart. In August, Bobbit told reporters he was only given $75,000 of the $400,000 raised. He also was given an RV to sleep in near the couple’s home but was taken away from in June when he was kicked off the property.</p><p>The money also remained in the couple’s bank account and the RV was also in their name. He sued the couple over mismanagement of funds. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">couple retaliated</a>, claiming Bobbit was given $200,000 and burned through $25,000 in less than two weeks on drugs and sending money to family.</p><p>The investigation into the couple’s handling of the money revealed their elaborate spending habits. Several social posts from&nbsp;McClure showcased the couple taking trips to Las Vegas for New Year’s Eve, helicopter rides, front row Broadway tickets and luxury shopping sprees. Police raided their home in September, seizing a BMW, jewelry and other items.</p><p>During the investigation, more clues suggested that the group were all in on the scam, which was to create a GoFundMe just to make money.</p><p>If convicted of the charges, all three will face up to 20 years in prison.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Family Of Hate Crime Victim Demands NYPD To Release Footage Of Stabbing</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5y%2FsMHPZp2am5mjtG62wKKjZqyZorJurcWtnKtlnZa4qrrGZmtpaJtivKeyjJ%2BYpJ1dnLynwc2dpJ5lk5a6sa3IoKVmbmFqhXKDjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
