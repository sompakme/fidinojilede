In a new interview with <a href=#>Variety</a>, the actress reflected on the sheer determination needed to execute the iconic role. “You got up at five in the morning, went to the gym to workout for two and a half hours,” she said. “Then you would head to Michael Peters and learn routines — which were all intense cardio — for about 10 hours. Ten hours! You had to be so focused and so determined. Pain was irrelevant.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a7qLHLmmSbmaOosrXAjKiqnJmiYn9xfpJmn6imn6eus8WMsKCnppWnenJ%2Bkm1ub3BjZ39w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
