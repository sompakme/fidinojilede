Although Twain had these ideas for her craft before they met, Lange was the spice she needed to make it colorful. “When you get together with the right person, all the right things seem to start happening,” the songstress said in a chat with Interview Magazine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lyme-disease-struck-shania-twain><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lyme Disease Struck Shania Twain</span></h2><p>The You’re Still The One star suffered a major setback in her career in 2003.
