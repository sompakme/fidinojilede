&#34;I am still wearing my ring. I think it's just pretty much a token of how I feel about this woman."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Not <strong>Seal</strong>.</p><p>On Tuesday, the 48-year-old singer appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where he continued to open about up about his recent separation from wife <strong>Heidi</strong> <strong>Klum</strong>, 38. (Seal first addressed their split during an interview with PBS talk show host <strong>Tavis Smiley</strong>.)</p><p>"I am still wearing my ring. I think it's just pretty much a token of how I feel about this woman. We have eight years. Eight wonderful years together," Seal told host <strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong>, 53. "Just because we have decided to separate doesn't necessarily mean you take off your ring and you're no longer connected to that person."</p><p>Despite his sudden split with Klum, Seal said he has "tremendous admiration, respect and love" for the German supermodel.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Will we wear the rings for the rest of our lives? Who knows?" he wondered. "But right now it feels really comfortable on my hand, so I have no intention of taking it off anytime soon."</p><p>The couple, who wed in 2005, have three biological children: Henry, 6, Johan, 5, and Lou, 2. In 2009, Seal adopted Klum's 7-year-old daughter, Leni, from her previous relationship with <strong>Flavio</strong> <strong>Briatore</strong>.</p><p>"Heidi has given me four incredible gifts: four beautiful children. She still, in my opinion, is the most wonderful woman in the world," Seal said. "I think our priority was to remain civil and do this thing with dignity. We still very much love each other."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasnZGheri02GagpmWjqbatuIywnJqqmaO0brnYZq6enJSeu6h50aKloGViZX5zfpNqZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
