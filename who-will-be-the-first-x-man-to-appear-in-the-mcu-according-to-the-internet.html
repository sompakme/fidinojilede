With this revelation comes reignited interest in the inevitable debut of the X-Men.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Actors Who Are Rumored To Be Cast As The MCU's X-men</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately for mutant fans, the X-Men won’t be making their triumphant debut until at least 2025, as Disney must honor the contracts of the actors who portrayed the X-Men in the Fox-verse; however, this hasn't stopped fans and websites alike from speculating who might be the first X-Man to be introduced within the MCU. These popular X-Men storylines are ready and waiting to be adapted along with the relationships associated with the team<a href=#> (here’s 10 we need to see)</a>, Whichever Xavier student shows up in the MCU first, fans are in for a veritable carnival ride.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=deadpool><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Deadpool</span></h2><p>Many fans of the X-Men lore were quite pleased when a Deadpool movie finally made it to the big screen. Played brilliantly by Ryan Reynolds and while<a href=#> Hollywood laughed at Reynolds for making the movie before it succeeded</a>, the movie was a huge hit for Fox. After Disney acquired the Fox library, it was announced that Reynolds’ Deadpool would make his way to the MCU at some point. Furthermore, Reynolds himself may have (sort of) spilled the beans on when “The Merc with a Mouth” might be debuting. According to cbr.com, Reynolds was asked by a fan when Deadpool would be appearing in the MCU, to which Reynolds responded only for his answer to be bleeped. He went on to tell the young girl to keep the info a secret.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gambit><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Gambit</span></h2><p>Gambit has been a fan favorite X-man since his debut in the comics back in the early '90s. The Cajun mutant first showed up on screen in the poorly received X-Men Origins: Wolverine, played by Taylor Hirsch. There is speculation that the mutant thief may be the first to debut in the MCU, not on the big screen, but on Disney+. According to inverse.com, “A new leak circulating on Twitter (and sourced to Marvel scooper Daniel RPK) Marvel Studios is currently casting some very specific roles for an untitled new show. The series seems to focus on the “Beaudreaux” family.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cyclops><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Cyclops</span></h2><p>Cyclops<strong> </strong>is not only Xavier’s first student, he is also like a son to the X-Men’s founder. So, it makes sense that the first X-man to debut in the MCU might be Scott “Cyclops” Summers. The stoic field leader of the X-Men was first brought to life on the big screen by James Marsden in the Fox films; however, Marsden’s version of the character was not well fleshed-out and left much to be desired. According to movieweb.com, actor Glen Powell<strong> </strong>may have been cast or is being considered<strong> </strong>as the ruby-eyed X-man, which has given rise to speculation, along with Ms. Marvel concept art featuring Cyclops that he may be the first of Xavier’s students to show up in the MCU.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Say This Is The Real Order To Experience The ‘X-Men’ Movies</a></span></p><h2 id=storm><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Storm</span></h2><p>According to wegotthiscovered.com, there are rumors surrounding Storm possibly debuting in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. With Namor and Riri Williams confirmed to be debuting within the film, it wouldn’t be too much of a stretch for fans to expect an unannounced appearance of the “Wind Rider.” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Storm also happens to be the ex-wife of T’Challa in the comics</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Twitter Argues Who Would Win In A Fight Between Avengers And X-Men</a></span></p><h2 id=rogue><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Rogue</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Debuting as an adversary of The Avengers, Rogue started off as a villain. Likewise, within the comics, Rogue gains (steals) most of her signature powers from Carol Danvers. According to MovieGasm.com, There have been rumors swirling that Rogue may be the first X-man (woman) to debut, and that her debut will be as the main villain in the upcoming The Marvels.</p><h2 id=professor-x><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Professor X</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">With his appearance in </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Doctor Strange In the Multiverse of Madness</a>, Professor Xavier made his triumphant debut alongside Reed Richards, Black Bolt, and the rest of the Illuminati, much to fan’s delight. However, this was, of course, the Fox version of the mutant telepath portrayed by Patrick Steward. This has fueled speculation online whether this was a one-off appearance for nostalgia purposes or if this is a sign that Xavier, whether the Fox version or a brand-new version, will be the first X-man to show up in the MCU. According to forbes.com, one of the reasons for Xavier being a possible candidate for first X-man to debut is a<strong> </strong>rumor<strong> </strong>that he has already been cast, with<strong> </strong>Giancarlo Esposito as the actor set to portray the X-Men’s leader.</p><h2 id=magneto><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Magneto</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Magneto<strong> </strong>was actually discussed by the producers of Multiverse of Madness to make a brief appearance; however, the “Master of Magnetism’s” appearance was never serious. There was a slight nod to Magneto in the film, as Strange and America Chavez traverse The Savage Land, Magneto’s home while on earth in the comic. This, combined with the fact that he is the father of Scarlet Witch in the comics, has led to speculation that Magneto may be the first to show up in the MCU.</p><h2 id=wolverine><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Wolverine</span></h2><p>What fan of the MCU doesn't want the feral mutant from the Great White North to be the first X-man to show up in the MCU? Wolverine was first brought to live action life in the Fox films by Hugh Jackman. And while there was speculation that Jackman would return in some way as Wolverine in the MCU, no reports seem to indicate that this will happen. According to YouTube channel, Everything Always, it was reported back in 2021 that Wolverine’s first MCU appearance would come in the form of a solo movie slated for release in 2024, which is also the character’s 50th anniversary and would've marked him as the first X-man to debut with Disney. However, we now know that the X-Men possibly won’t be making their appearance until sometime after 2025.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrLatuIybnGasmJp6p7XRrKtmsF2irq9506hkmqigmq6zecinZK2glWK6pMGMmpqcp6KZtq%2BzjK2mZqyYmnqqutOeqaedpGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
